## Recurring Design Elements

Use these consistently across ALL templates in the pack:

- **Heart icons** — small filled hearts (Villa Pink) as bullet points or separators
- **Palm tree silhouettes** — corner accents on signs, subtle watermark on game cards
- **Tropical leaves** — monstera or palm leaf as border accents (use sparingly)
- **Phone notification bubble** — rounded rectangle with tail, used on "New Message" items
- **Flamingo icon** — optional small accent, 1-2 items max (don't overdo it)
- **Gold star** — small star accents near headers or as bullet points
- **Dotted or dashed divider lines** — in Villa Pink or Gold, between sections on cards

**Border style:** Thin (2-3px) rounded rectangle border in Villa Pink on all game cards.
Signs use a thicker (4-6px) border or a decorative tropical frame.

## Canva Template Sharing

For items marked "customizable" in the briefs below, you'll create a **Canva
template link** that buyers can access:

1. Design the template in Canva
2. Click Share > More > Template link
3. Buyer opens the link, Canva creates their own copy, they edit the text fields
4. Include this link in the Etsy download PDF as: "Click here to customize in Canva (free)"

Mark editable text with placeholder text like: `[BRIDE'S NAME]`, `[DATE]`, `[LOCATION]`
