## How to help me

Walk me through building each item ONE AT A TIME in Canva. For each item:
1. Tell me the exact Canva document to create (size, type)
2. Give me step-by-step placement instructions (what to add, where, what size, what color)
3. Tell me exactly what text to type and how to format it
4. Tell me when to duplicate pages, add cut marks, etc.
5. Remind me of export settings when I finish each item

Start with Item 1: "Drink If..." and ask me when I'm ready to move to the next item. Keep your instructions specific and actionable — assume I know basic Canva but need exact specs.
