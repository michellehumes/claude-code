each question. Then the MOH reveals the groom's answers one at a time.

**Scoring:**
- Exact match = 2 points
- Close enough (group decides) = 1 point

- 16-20 points: Soulmates. 10-15: Solid. Under 10: Yikes (but entertaining).

### Page 3: Bride's Answer Sheet

Same 10 questions but framed for her:
1. Where was your first date?
2. What was his first impression of you? (What do you THINK he said?)
3. What does he think your most annoying habit is?
4. What's HIS most annoying habit?
5. What's your go-to comfort food?
6. What would he say is your best quality?
7. What's the one thing you always argue about?
8. How would he describe your perfect Sunday in 5 words?
9. What's the most romantic thing he's done for you?
10. If he could relive one moment together, which would he pick?

Bride's sheet has Villa Pink border. Both have the same layout otherwise.
