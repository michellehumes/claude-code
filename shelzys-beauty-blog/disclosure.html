<h2>How This Blog Earns Money</h2>
<p>Shelzy's Beauty Blog is a participant in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</p>
<p>This means that when you click on a product link on this blog and make a purchase on Amazon, I may earn a small commission at <strong>absolutely no additional cost to you</strong>. The price you pay is the same whether you use my affiliate link or go directly to Amazon.</p>
<h2>My Affiliate Tag</h2>
<p>Product links on this site use the Amazon Associates tag <strong>shelzysbeauty-20</strong>. This tag is how Amazon tracks that a purchase originated from my recommendation.</p>
<h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
<p>My product recommendations are based entirely on my personal testing and experience. I follow these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I only recommend products I've personally tested</strong> — typically for a minimum of 2 weeks, often longer</li>
<li><strong>I never recommend a product solely because of commission rates</strong> — a $5 product I love gets the same enthusiasm as a $100 product</li>
<li><strong>I include honest cons alongside pros</strong> — no product is perfect, and I'll tell you the downsides</li>
<li><strong>I don't accept payment for positive reviews</strong> — my opinions are my own</li>
<li><strong>I update recommendations regularly</strong> — if a product's quality changes or a better alternative emerges, I update my content</li>
</ul>
<h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
<p>In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines, I disclose that this blog receives affiliate compensation. Every blog post containing affiliate links includes a disclosure notice at the top of the article.</p>
<h2>Why I Use Affiliate Links</h2>
<p>Testing beauty products, writing detailed reviews, and maintaining this blog takes significant time and investment. Affiliate commissions help cover these costs and allow me to continue providing free, honest beauty content. Your support through these links is genuinely appreciated.</p>
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this disclosure or my affiliate relationships, please don't hesitate to reach out. Transparency is important to me, and I'm happy to explain how any aspect of this blog works.</p>
