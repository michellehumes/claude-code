    body=f'''<p>LED light therapy has been used in dermatologist offices for decades. Red light stimulates collagen production, blue light kills acne-causing bacteria, and near-infrared penetrates deeper for healing. Now you can get this technology at home — but are the at-home versions actually worth it?</p>
<p>I tested five LED masks ranging from $40 to $455, using each for the manufacturer's recommended protocol for 8 weeks. Here's what actually works.</p>
