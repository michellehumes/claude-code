<p>I used it every morning and night for 30 days straight to find out. Here's my completely honest experience.</p>

<h2>What Is Snail Mucin?</h2>
<p>Snail mucin (snail secretion filtrate) is the mucus that snails produce to protect and repair their skin. It's rich in glycoproteins, hyaluronic acid, glycolic acid, and zinc — all ingredients proven to benefit human skin. The snails aren't harmed in collection.</p>

<h2>My 30-Day Journal</h2>
<h3>Week 1: Getting Used to the Texture</h3>
<p>The texture is like... slightly stretchy water? It's not as gross as it sounds but it's definitely different. It absorbs within 60 seconds and leaves skin feeling hydrated and slightly dewy. No breakouts or irritation.</p>
<h3>Week 2: The Glow Appears</h3>
<p>By day 10, I started noticing that my skin looked... glowier? Not shiny, not oily, but genuinely luminous from within. The kind of glow you usually only get from a good facial. Two coworkers asked what I'd changed about my skin.</p>
<h3>Week 3: Texture Improvement</h3>
<p>My rough patches and bumpy texture started smoothing out. Acne scars from months ago looked less noticeable. Skin felt bouncier and more resilient.</p>
<h3>Week 4: The Verdict Crystallizes</h3>
<p>By day 30, my skin was noticeably more hydrated, glowing, and smoother compared to day 1. Post-acne marks had faded visibly. My skin barrier felt stronger — products applied after the mucin absorbed better.</p>
