<p>Olaplex and K18 are the two biggest names in bond repair, but they work completely differently. I tested both on my bleach-damaged hair for 8 weeks — using Olaplex on one side and K18 on the other (yes, really) — to give you a definitive comparison.</p>
<h2>How They Work</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SNM5US4?tag=shelzysbeauty-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Olaplex No. 3</a> ($30)</strong> uses bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate to relink broken disulfide bonds. It's a pre-shampoo treatment — apply to damp hair, leave for 10+ minutes, then shampoo and condition normally.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JFDQRWN?tag=shelzysbeauty-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">K18 Leave-In Mask</a> ($29)</strong> uses a patented bioactive peptide (K18PEPTIDE) that reconnects broken keratin chains. It's a leave-in — apply to damp, freshly-shampooed hair and let it air dry. No rinsing, no conditioner needed.</p>

<h2>My 8-Week Results</h2>
<p><strong>Weeks 1-2:</strong> K18 showed faster initial improvement. Hair felt noticeably smoother and more elastic after the very first use. Olaplex was subtle.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 3-4:</strong> Olaplex started catching up. Both sides showed significant improvement in strength and reduced breakage.</p>
<p><strong>Weeks 5-8:</strong> By week 8, both treatments delivered comparable results in overall hair health. K18 had a slight edge in smoothness; Olaplex had a slight edge in natural movement.</p>
<h2>Final Verdict</h2>
<p><strong>Choose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JFDQRWN?tag=shelzysbeauty-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">K18</a> if:</strong> You want faster results, prefer leave-in convenience, and don't mind the higher per-use cost.</p>
<p><strong>Choose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SNM5US4?tag=shelzysbeauty-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Olaplex No. 3</a> if:</strong> You want the original proven formula, prefer a more affordable per-use cost, and don't mind the extra time.</p>
<p><strong>My honest pick:</strong> K18 by a slight margin, purely for the convenience factor. Four minutes with no rinsing changed my wash routine.</p><div class="faq-section"><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Can I use both Olaplex and K18?</div><div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes, but on different wash days. They work on different types of bonds and can complement each other.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">How often should I use each?</div><div class="faq-answer"><p>Olaplex: once a week. K18: every wash for the first 4-6 washes, then as needed.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Do these work on virgin (undamaged) hair?</div><div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes, but the effects are less dramatic since there's less damage to repair.</p></div></div></div>
