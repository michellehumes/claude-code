<h2>Hey, I'm Shelzy!</h2>
<p>I'm a beauty enthusiast who got tired of wasting money on hyped-up products that didn't work. After spending thousands on skincare, haircare, and makeup over the years — some amazing, most disappointing — I started this blog to share what actually works.</p>
<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>I test beauty products the hard way: on my own skin, for weeks at a time, with honest assessments. No sponsored reviews, no paid promotions disguised as recommendations. When I say a product works, it's because I've used it myself and seen real results.</p>
<p>Every product on this blog has been tested for a minimum of 2 weeks (most for 4-8 weeks). I evaluate on five criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Does it actually do what it claims?</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> Is it worth the price?</li>
<li><strong>Texture & Experience:</strong> Is it pleasant to use daily?</li>
<li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Are the ingredients evidence-based and safe?</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Can most people find and afford it?</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
<p>Great skincare doesn't have to be expensive. Some of the best products I've ever used cost under $15 on Amazon. I believe in science-backed ingredients, honest reviews, and helping you find products that work for YOUR skin — not just whatever's trending on TikTok this week.</p>
<h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
<p>This blog contains affiliate links. When you purchase through my links, I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps me keep testing products and writing honest reviews. I never recommend a product just because it pays well — my recommendations are based solely on my personal testing and experience. Read my full <a href="disclosure.html">affiliate disclosure</a>.</p>
