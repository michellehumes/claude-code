The beauty industry wants you to believe that effective skincare requires spending hundreds of dollars. That's simply not true. Some of the most dermatologist-recommended products on the market cost under $15 each.

We built a complete, science-backed skincare routine using only affordable products — and the total comes in under $50. Every product in this lineup has earned praise from skincare professionals.

## The Core Steps You Actually Need

A solid routine doesn't need 10 steps. Here's what dermatologists actually recommend:

1. **Cleanser** — Remove dirt, oil, and makeup
2. **Treatment** — Target your specific concerns
3. **Moisturizer** — Hydrate and protect your barrier
4. **Sunscreen** — Prevent damage and aging (morning only)

Consistency beats complexity every time. A simple routine you stick to daily will outperform an elaborate one you only do occasionally.
