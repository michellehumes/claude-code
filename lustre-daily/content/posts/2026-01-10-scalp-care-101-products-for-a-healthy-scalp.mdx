## Application Tips for Best Results

Getting the most out of your products often comes down to technique:

- **Order matters**: Apply products from thinnest to thickest consistency.
- **Less is more**: Start with a small amount—you can always add more.
- **Give it time**: Most products need 4-6 weeks of consistent use to show full results.
