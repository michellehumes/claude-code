Whether it's heat styling, chemical treatments, or environmental damage, most of us deal with dry, damaged hair at some point. A good hair mask can genuinely transform the health and appearance of your strands — but not all masks are created equal.

We tested over a dozen hair masks on different hair types and damage levels to find the ones that truly deliver salon-quality repair at home.

## Signs Your Hair Needs a Mask

If any of these sound familiar, a weekly hair mask should be part of your routine:

- Hair feels rough or straw-like when dry
- Tangles form easily, especially when wet
- Split ends are multiplying despite regular trims
- Hair looks dull and lacks shine
- Color fades faster than it should

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
For maximum absorption, apply your hair mask to damp (not soaking wet) hair. Excess water dilutes the formula and prevents ingredients from penetrating the hair shaft.

## How to Use a Hair Mask Effectively

The application technique matters as much as the product:

1. **Shampoo first** to remove buildup that blocks absorption
2. **Squeeze out excess water** — damp hair absorbs better than dripping hair
3. **Focus on mid-lengths to ends** where damage concentrates
4. **Use a wide-tooth comb** to distribute the mask evenly
5. **Leave on for the recommended time** — more isn't always better with protein treatments
6. **Rinse with cool water** to seal the hair cuticle

<Callout type="expert" title="Expert Advice">
Alternate between protein-based masks (like Olaplex and K18) and moisture-based masks. Too much protein can make hair brittle, while too much moisture can leave it limp. Balance is key.
</Callout>

## Mask Frequency Guide

- **Mildly damaged hair**: Once every 1-2 weeks
- **Moderately damaged hair**: Once a week
- **Severely damaged hair**: Twice a week for the first month, then weekly
- **Color-treated hair**: Weekly, focusing on bond-repair formulas

## The Bottom Line

A quality hair mask is one of the most impactful additions you can make to your hair care routine. The difference between damaged, dull hair and soft, shiny strands often comes down to consistent deep conditioning.

Start with a bond-repair treatment like Olaplex or K18 for structural damage, and complement it with a moisturizing mask for softness. Your hair will thank you within weeks.
