## Production Notes

### Color Palette
Use the same Easter pastel palette as the listing images:
- Soft Pink: #FFD1DC
- Lavender: #C8B6E8

- Butter Yellow: #FFF5BA
- Sky Blue: #AED6F1
- Peach: #FFDAB9

- Coral (accent): #FF9F7A

### Typography
- Headlines: Bold sans-serif (Montserrat Bold or Poppins Bold)
- Body: Clean sans-serif (Open Sans or Nunito)
- Avoid script/cursive fonts — keep it clean and modern

### Design Style
- Clean, modern, and professional
- Pastel colors with high contrast text
- Subtle animations (no jarring transitions)
- Easter motifs: eggs, bunnies, flowers, spring elements
- Match the aesthetic of the listing images exactly

### Tools to Create
- **Canva**: Use "Create a Video" with 1080x1080 canvas (free)
- **CapCut**: Free video editor with animation templates
- **Adobe Express**: Quick video from templates

### Key Tips
1. First 2-3 seconds must grab attention
2. Show the PRODUCT, not just text
3. Keep text large and readable (people view on mobile)
4. Use the listing image designs as "frames" in the video
5. Ensure it loops smoothly (last frame matches first frame mood)
