### For Wedding Planning / Bachelorette Groups

**Value Post (Not Selling)**
```
Hey everyone! Just planned my best friend's bachelorette and wanted to share what worked in case it helps anyone else:

WHAT WE DID:
- Booked an Airbnb with a pool (4 nights, split 8 ways = very affordable)
- Got matching personalised water bottles for everyone (huge hit, everyone kept theirs)
- Printed party games at home — we did a "Drink If" game and Dare Cards
- Made themed cocktail name cards for the bar (so cute for photos)
- Had a "Welcome to the Villa" sign at the front door

WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY:
- Order bottles 3-4 weeks early (not 2 weeks... learned that one the hard way)
- Print on cardstock instead of regular paper — it holds up SO much better
- Plan the itinerary in advance but keep it flexible

Happy to answer any questions! Planning a bachelorette is stressful but so rewarding when you see it all come together.
```

**Soft Sell Post (When Self-Promotion Is Allowed)**
```
I created a printable villa-themed bachelorette party pack after struggling to find one that didn't look generic or use copyrighted branding.

It includes 8 party games (Drink If, Dare Cards, Trivia, etc.), 7 signs and decor, planning templates, and extras like cocktail name cards and Instagram story frames.

Everything's an instant download — print at home or at a print shop. We also do matching personalised water bottles with everyone's name in cursive script.

If you're planning a villa-themed bach weekend, this might save you a LOT of piecing things together from different shops!

Happy to answer any questions. (Mods — delete if not allowed!)
