### Custom Design Request
```
Hi [Name]!

Thanks for your message! I appreciate you thinking of us for a custom design.

Right now, our bottles come in the signature cursive script that everyone loves — it's our bestseller and what the Villa Vibes brand is known for. I want to make sure every bottle looks consistent and high-quality, so I don't currently offer custom fonts or designs.

WHAT I CAN DO:
— Any name, nickname, or word ("Bride," "Wifey," "Bestie," etc.)
— 5 script colours: Classic Black, Hot Pink, Rose Gold, Gold, White
— 2 sizes: 500ml or 750ml
— Different script colours for different bottles in a group order

If any of that works for what you have in mind, I'd love to help! Just let me know the details.

### Rush Order Inquiry
```
Hi [Name]!

I totally understand the time pressure — bachelorette planning can be hectic!

Here's how rush processing works:

— Rush fee: +$4.99 per bottle
— Rush timeline: Your bottle(s) ship the NEXT business day after you approve the proof
— I'll send the proof within a few hours of your order (not 24 hours)

After shipping, delivery time depends on your location:
— UK: 2-5 business days
— US: 5-10 business days
— International: 7-21 business days

If you let me know your event date and location, I can tell you if we'll make it in time!

Ready to order? Just purchase the listing, select "Rush Processing," and I'll prioritise your order immediately.

## HANDLING NEGATIVE FEEDBACK

### Item Arrived Damaged
```
Hi [Name],

I'm so sorry your bottle arrived damaged — that's really frustrating, and it's absolutely not the experience I want you to have.

Could you send me a photo of the damage? I want to see what happened so I can:
1. Send you a replacement right away (no charge, of course)
2. Improve my packaging to prevent this in the future

I'll get a new bottle made and shipped as soon as I hear back from you. If you need it by a certain date, let me know and I'll rush it at no extra cost.

Again, I'm really sorry about this. I'll make it right!

[Your Name] x
```

### Name Spelled Incorrectly
```
Hi [Name],

Oh no — I'm so sorry about the spelling error! Let me fix this right away.

I'll make a new bottle with the correct spelling and ship it to you ASAP at no charge. You're welcome to keep the original bottle too.

Could you confirm the correct spelling for me one more time? I want to triple-check before I start production.

I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. I'll get this sorted as fast as I can.

[Your Name] x
```

### Delivery Delay
```
Hi [Name],

I completely understand your frustration — I know you have an event coming up and timing matters.

Let me check the tracking right now: [Tracking link]

[If still in transit]: The package is showing as [status] — it looks like the carrier is running [X days] behind their estimate. Unfortunately, once it's shipped I can't control the carrier's timeline, but I'm monitoring it closely.

[If lost]: If the package doesn't arrive by [date], I will make and ship a replacement at no charge — with rush processing so it gets to you as fast as possible.

Please keep me updated, and I'll do the same. I want to make sure you have your bottles for the event!

[Your Name] x
