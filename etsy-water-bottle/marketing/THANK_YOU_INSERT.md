THANK YOU

You're officially part of the Villa.

Thank you so much for your order — I hope you love your personalised bottle as much as I loved making it. If you have a moment, I'd be so grateful for a quick review on Etsy. It means the world to small shops like mine.

Enjoy your villa weekend!

### QR Code Notes:
- Generate the QR code linking to your Etsy shop section (Villa Vibes collection) or directly to the digital party pack listing
- Use a URL shortener with tracking (e.g., bit.ly) so you can measure how many people scan
- Test the QR code on multiple phones before printing a batch
- Free QR generators: qr-code-generator.com, canva.com (built-in)

## Canva Design Notes

### Font Choices:
- "Villa Vibes" header: Use a script/cursive font (e.g., Playlist Script, Sacramento, or Dancing Script)
- "Thank You" and body text: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins, or Raleway)
- Keep font choices consistent with your Etsy listing images

### Colour Palette:
- Background: White (#FFFFFF) or soft peach (#FFDAB9)
- Primary text: Dark grey (#333333) — not pure black, which looks harsh
- Accent text/hearts: Hot pink (#FF1493) or rose gold (#B76E79)
- QR code: Dark grey or black on white background for maximum scannability

### Design Tips:
- Keep it clean and uncluttered — resist the urge to fill every inch
- White space is your friend
- The QR code needs to be at least 1" x 1" to scan reliably
- Don't make the cross-sell feel too "salesy" — it should feel like a helpful suggestion, not a billboard

## Print Cost Estimate

| Quantity | Estimated Cost | Cost Per Card |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 100 cards | ~$15-20 (Vistaprint) | ~$0.15-0.20 |
| 250 cards | ~$25-35 (Vistaprint) | ~$0.10-0.14 |
| 500 cards | ~$40-50 (Vistaprint) | ~$0.08-0.10 |
| Canva Print (100) | ~$25-30 | ~$0.25-0.30 |

At $0.10-0.15 per card, this is one of the cheapest marketing tools available — and if even 5% of customers scan the QR code and buy the digital pack ($27.99), the ROI is massive.
