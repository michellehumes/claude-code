## ETSY ADS STRATEGY

### Budget Allocation by Product

| Product | Daily Ad Budget | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Villa Vibes Water Bottle (single) | $3-5/day | HIGH | Broadest appeal, year-round |
| Villa Vibes Bundle | $2-4/day | HIGH | Highest AOV, best ROI |
| Villa Vibes Party Pack | $1-3/day | MEDIUM | Digital = 100% margin |
| Acrylic Place Cards | $2-3/day | MEDIUM | Seasonal (spring/autumn peaks) |
| Budget Bundle | $1-2/day | LOW (seasonal) | Peak in Jan and tax season |
| Wellness Tracker | $1-2/day | LOW (seasonal) | Peak in Jan |
| Business Planner | $1-2/day | LOW | Steady but lower volume |
| Side Hustle Tracker | $1-2/day | LOW (seasonal) | Peak in tax season |

### Total Suggested Monthly Ad Spend
- **Off-season (Aug, Oct):** $150-250/month
- **Normal season (Mar, Apr, Jul, Sep):** $250-400/month
- **Peak season (May, Jun, Nov, Dec):** $400-600/month
- **Black Friday week:** $100-150 (one week only)

### Etsy Ads Best Practices

1. **Start small, scale winners.** Begin at $1/day per listing. After 7 days, check which listings have the best ROAS (return on ad spend). Scale those up, pause the losers.

2. **Turn off ads for listings with <4.0 star reviews.** Ads drive traffic but bad reviews kill conversion. Fix the product/service first.

3. **Seasonal rotation.** Don't run all products all year. Pause digital planners in summer; pause Villa Vibes bottles in deep winter (Jan/Feb) unless you're targeting Valentine's.

4. **Title test.** Etsy uses your title for ad matching. If a listing isn't getting impressions, the title may not match what buyers are searching. A/B test titles monthly.

5. **Photo is everything.** The #1 factor in ad click-through rate is your hero image. If CTR is low (<1%), test a new hero image before increasing budget.

6. **Free shipping threshold.** Etsy promotes listings with free shipping more aggressively in search. If your margins allow, offer free shipping on orders over $35 (Etsy's threshold) and enable the "free shipping guarantee."
