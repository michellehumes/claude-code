## General Photography Tips

1. **Lighting:** Natural daylight is best. Shoot near a large window between 10am-2pm. Avoid harsh direct sun — use a white sheet as a diffuser if needed.
2. **Consistency:** Use the same background surface (white marble tile from Home Depot, ~$3) across all product shots for brand cohesion.
3. **Props:** Keep a "styling kit" — pink sunglasses, gold confetti, tropical leaves (fake is fine), coral/peach fabric, and small flowers.
4. **Editing:** Bright, slightly warm colour grading. Increase exposure slightly, boost whites, add a touch of warmth. Don't over-filter — keep it clean and real.
5. **Etsy image format:** 2700 x 3375px (4:5 ratio) is optimal for Etsy. First image MUST look good at thumbnail size (small phone screen).
6. **File size:** Keep under 5MB per image for fast Etsy loading.
