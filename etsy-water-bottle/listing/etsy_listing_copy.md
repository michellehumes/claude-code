### TAG STRATEGY NOTES
- Tags avoid "Love Island" entirely to prevent trademark issues and potential listing removal
- "villa" captures organic search traffic from fans searching for the show-inspired aesthetic
- "reality tv bottle" captures the broader audience searching for this style
- "hen party" and "bachelorette" capture the primary use case buyers
- "personalised" uses British spelling to capture UK market (Etsy matches both US/UK spellings, but UK buyers are a core demographic for this product)
- "bridesmaid gift" and "personalised gift" capture gift-occasion searches year-round
- "villa vibes" reinforces the brand name across listings for cohesive shop identity

## LISTING IMAGES (recommended order for maximum conversion)

### Image 1: HERO / THUMBNAIL
**What:** Clean product shot of the bottle with an aspirational name ("Sophie" or "Olivia") on a bright, summery background — poolside, tropical leaves, or clean marble surface.
**Why:** First impression. Must be scroll-stopping. Bright, clean, professional. The name should be legible at thumbnail size.
**Tips:** Use natural lighting. Avoid cluttered backgrounds. The bottle should take up 70-80% of the frame.

### Image 2: LIFESTYLE — THE VILLA VIBE
**What:** Styled flat lay or lifestyle shot — bottle next to sunglasses, a straw hat, a bikini, tropical drink, or by a pool. Summer party energy.
**Why:** Creates the emotional connection. Buyer sees themselves living the villa fantasy.
**Tips:** Hot pink and coral accents in the styling to match the villa aesthetic. This image sells the *feeling*, not just the product.

### Image 3: PERSONALISATION SHOWCASE
**What:** Multiple bottles lined up showing different names and script colours (Black, Hot Pink, Rose Gold, Gold, White). Show 4-5 bottles together.
**Why:** Shows the personalisation options and immediately communicates "hen party / group order." Buyers picture their friend group.
**Tips:** Arrange bottles in a slight fan or row. Use popular names. This is also a great image for the "Bulk Orders" sell.

### Image 4: FEATURES & SPECS INFOGRAPHIC
**What:** Clean graphic overlay showing key features: "Double-Walled Stainless Steel | Keeps Cold 24hrs / Hot 12hrs | Leak-Proof Flip Straw Lid | BPA-Free | 500ml or 750ml"
**Why:** Converts browsers who need the practical details before buying. Answers "is this actually a good bottle?" without them needing to read the full description.
**Tips:** Keep it clean and on-brand. Use the same fonts/colors as your other listing images.

### Image 5: SCRIPT CLOSE-UP
**What:** Tight close-up of the cursive script on the bottle, showing the quality and detail of the personalisation.
**Why:** Quality assurance. Buyers want to see exactly what the lettering looks like. This builds confidence in the product.
**Tips:** Sharp focus, good lighting. Show the texture and finish of the vinyl/print.

### Image 6: SIZE COMPARISON
**What:** Both bottle sizes (500ml and 750ml) side by side, ideally held or next to a common object for scale (hand, standard coffee cup, phone).
**Why:** Helps buyers choose the right size. Reduces "is this big enough?" hesitation.

### Image 7: GIFT / UNBOXING
**What:** Bottle presented as a gift — in tissue paper, a gift box, or alongside the Villa Vibes digital party pack printouts.
**Why:** Captures the gifting market. Shows the buyer how it'll look when their friend opens it. Cross-sells the digital party pack.
**Tips:** Include a small card or tag that says "Villa Vibes" for brand cohesion.

### Image 8: GROUP SHOT / SOCIAL PROOF
**What:** A group of bottles together in a party setting — a table at a bachelorette party, poolside on loungers, or held up by a group of friends (can use hands only if no faces available).
**Why:** Social proof and aspiration. Shows the product "in action" at the exact event buyers are purchasing it for.
**Tips:** This is your best image for UGC — if customers send party photos, use them (with permission) here.

### Image 9: CROSS-SELL
**What:** Bottles displayed alongside the printed Villa Vibes Bachelorette Party Pack items — game cards, signs, name badges.
**Why:** Plants the seed: "I need both of these." Drives traffic to the digital download listing.
**Tips:** Style it as a complete "party planning" flat lay.

### Image 10: REVIEWS / TRUST (optional)
**What:** Graphic with 2-3 customer review quotes overlaid on a lifestyle background.
**Why:** Social proof closes sales. If you have great reviews, feature them.
**Tips:** Only use once you have strong reviews. Until then, use one of the above images doubled up.

## CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION NOTES

### Why This Listing Is Designed to Convert:

1. **Title front-loads "Personalised" and "Villa"** — the two highest-intent keywords for this audience. Buyers searching for the show-inspired bottle will find it; buyers searching for any personalised bottle will also find it.

2. **Description opens with emotional hook, not specs** — "Your name. Your bottle. Main character energy." speaks directly to the buyer's identity and desire. Product specs come after they're already emotionally engaged.

3. **Bulk pricing is prominently featured** — hen parties and bachelorette weekends are group purchases. Making bundle pricing easy to find converts single-bottle browsers into 6-8 bottle orders.

4. **Cross-sell to the digital party pack** — every water bottle buyer is a potential digital download buyer. The description seeds this naturally without feeling pushy.

5. **FAQ section reduces purchase anxiety** — personalised products have higher cart abandonment because buyers worry about mistakes. The FAQ addresses spelling errors, proofing, and returns directly.

6. **"Digital proof before printing" is a trust signal** — this differentiates from sellers who just print and ship. It signals professionalism and reduces return risk.

7. **Image strategy tells a story** — Hero (product) → Lifestyle (aspiration) → Options (personalisation) → Specs (logic) → Quality (close-up) → Size (decision) → Gift (occasion) → Social (proof) → Cross-sell (upsell). This mirrors the buyer's mental journey from "what is this?" to "I need this."

8. **British + American spelling covered** — "Personalised" in the listing with "Personalized" in tags captures both markets. Etsy's search handles spelling variants, but explicit coverage helps.

9. **Seasonal versatility in "Perfect For" section** — the listing works year-round (gym, everyday, birthday) not just bachelorette season. This keeps sales steady outside peak wedding months.

10. **Script colour options create visual variety** — Hot Pink and Rose Gold are the hero colours (most associated with the villa aesthetic) but offering Classic Black and White broadens the appeal beyond the core fan audience.
