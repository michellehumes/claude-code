## Pricing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency** - All pricing publicly available, no hidden fees
2. **Scalability** - Pricing grows with firm success, not punishes it
3. **Value-Based** - Priced on value delivered, not just features
4. **Accessibility** - Entry point for firms of any size
5. **Predictability** - No surprise bills, clear cost structure

### Pricing Model: Hybrid SaaS + AUM

We employ a **hybrid model** combining:
- **Base Platform Fee** - Fixed monthly cost for platform access
- **AUM Component** - Small basis point fee that scales with assets
- **Add-on Modules** - Optional premium features

This approach:
- Ensures accessibility for smaller firms (low base fee)
- Aligns our success with client success (AUM component)
- Avoids punitive pricing as firms grow (capped AUM fees)
