## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS NOTES

### vs. Sea Glass Place Cards ($3.75):
**Advantages of Acrylic:**
- More consistent size and shape
- Smoother writing surface for cleaner calligraphy
- More modern/contemporary look
- Easier to read names
- More durable (won't chip like glass)

**Positioning:**
- Emphasize "hand painted" (artisan quality)
- Highlight durability as keepsake
- Focus on trending sage green color

### Market Opportunity:
- Sage green is peak trending color for 2025-2026 weddings
- Most acrylic place cards on Etsy are clear or engraved
- Hand-painted colored acrylic is less common = differentiation
- Consider adding more colors later (dusty blue, terracotta, blush)

---

## FUTURE EXPANSION IDEAS

### Additional Colors to Add:
1. Dusty blue (very popular for weddings)
2. Blush pink
3. Terracotta/rust
4. Clear/transparent
5. Black (for modern/minimalist weddings)
6. White/ivory

### Additional Products:
- Matching table numbers
- Menu cards
- Escort card displays
- Thank you cards in same style

## MY ASSESSMENT

### Is This a Good Listing? YES - Here's Why:

**Strengths:**
1. **Trending Color**: Sage green is THE color for 2025-2026 weddings according to multiple industry sources
2. **Hand Painted Differentiator**: Most competitors use laser engraving - hand painted is more unique and commands premium
3. **Good Price Point**: $4.25 is competitive while reflecting hand-made quality
4. **Faster Turnaround**: 7-10 days vs competitor's 3 weeks is a major selling point
5. **High Demand Category**: Wedding place cards consistently sell well on Etsy

**Considerations:**
1. **Time Investment**: Hand painting is labor intensive - calculate your hourly rate
2. **Scalability**: Consider if you can handle bulk orders during peak wedding season (May-October)
3. **Photography**: Great photos will make or break this listing - invest time here
4. **Video**: Etsy's 2026 algorithm heavily favors listings with video

**Recommendations:**
1. Start with this sage green listing to test the market
2. Order quality acrylic blanks in bulk to reduce cost per piece
3. Practice your calligraphy style and photograph your best work
4. Consider adding a video showing the painting process
5. If this sells well, expand to dusty blue and clear acrylic
6. Track which paint color (white, gold, silver) is most popular
