### Value Post (Not Selling)
```
Hey everyone! 👋

Quick tax tip for side hustlers:

Did you know you can deduct your mileage to the post office at $0.67 per mile (2025 rate)?

If you ship orders 3x per week and the post office is 5 miles away, that's:
3 trips × 10 miles round trip × 52 weeks × $0.67 = $1,046 in deductions! 🤯

The key is TRACKING IT. You need:
- Date
- Destination
- Business purpose
- Miles driven

I keep a simple log and it's saved me hundreds every year.

Anyone else tracking mileage? What's your system?
```

### Soft Pitch Post (When Allowed)
```
After 3 years of messy spreadsheets and tax season panic, I finally created the system I wish I had from day one.

It's a Google Sheets tracker that handles:
✅ Multiple income streams (Etsy, eBay, Poshmark, freelance, etc.)
✅ Expense categories mapped to Schedule C
✅ Automatic profit calculations
✅ Mileage tracking
✅ Quarterly tax estimates

Just sharing in case anyone else is drowning in receipts like I was! Happy to answer questions if you want to know more.

(Mods - delete if not allowed! 🙏)

### Value Email (Day 3)
```
Subject: The #1 tracking mistake (and how to avoid it)

Hi [Name]!

Quick story:

My first year with a side hustle, I tracked REVENUE but not PROFIT.

I thought I made $15,000. 🎉
After fees, supplies, and shipping? $8,000. 😬

The lesson? Track your REAL numbers:
- Gross income
- Platform fees
- Cost of goods
- Shipping costs
- Business expenses

= ACTUAL PROFIT

That's the number that matters for taxes AND for knowing if your hustle is worth the time.

Are you tracking profit or just revenue?

Hit reply - I read every response!

[Your Name]
```

### Soft Pitch Email (Day 7)
```
Subject: Ready to level up your tracking?

Hi [Name]!

Over the past week, I've shared some tips about tracking your side hustle finances.

If you've been:
❌ Using notes apps and random spreadsheets
❌ Guessing at tax time
❌ Not sure if you're actually profitable
❌ Stressed about organizing multiple income streams

I built something that might help.

The Side Hustle Empire Tracker is a Google Sheets template that:

📊 Tracks income from 15+ platforms
💳 Organizes expenses by tax category
🧾 Calculates quarterly estimated taxes
🎯 Helps you set and track income goals
🚗 Includes IRS-compliant mileage tracking

It's what I wish existed when I started.

→ [Check it out here]

No pressure at all - the free tracker you already have works great for basics!

But if you want the full system, this is it.
