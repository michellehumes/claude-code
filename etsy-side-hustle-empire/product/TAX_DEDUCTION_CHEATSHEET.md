3. **Forgetting mileage** - Track EVERY business trip
4. **Not tracking small expenses** - They add up!
5. **Over-claiming home office** - Must be exclusive use

|---------|--------------|----------|
| Q1 | Jan 1 - Mar 31 | April 15 |

**Pay if you expect to owe $1,000+ in taxes**

## 🧮 QUICK TAX ESTIMATE

```
Net Profit (Income - Expenses) × 0.25 to 0.30 = Estimated Tax

Example:
$20,000 net profit × 0.25 = $5,000 estimated tax
$5,000 ÷ 4 quarters = $1,250 per quarter
```

This includes:
- Self-employment tax (~15.3%)
- Federal income tax (~10-12% for most side hustlers)
