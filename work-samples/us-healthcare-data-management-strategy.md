# US Healthcare Data Management Strategy Work Sample

## Overview

This document provides a sample summary of my approach to developing and implementing data management strategies for US healthcare organizations, including large integrated health systems similar to Aspirus Healthcare and Advocate Aurora Health.

## Key Steps

### 1. Current State Assessment
- Conduct comprehensive audit of existing data infrastructure and systems (EHR, claims, clinical, operational)
- Map data flows across departments and identify integration points
- Evaluate current data governance policies and compliance posture
- Assess data quality metrics and identify gaps in data integrity

### 2. Strategy Development
- Define strategic objectives aligned with organizational goals (population health, value-based care, operational efficiency)
- Develop data governance framework with clear ownership and stewardship roles
- Create data quality improvement roadmap with measurable KPIs
- Design master data management (MDM) strategy for patient, provider, and facility data

### 3. BI Reporting & Analytics Architecture
- Design enterprise BI reporting framework for clinical, financial, and operational insights
- Implement self-service analytics capabilities for business users
- Build executive dashboards for real-time performance monitoring
- Establish data visualization standards and reporting governance

### 4. Compliance & Security Framework
- Ensure HIPAA compliance across all data management processes
- Implement data access controls and audit logging
- Develop data retention and archival policies
- Create incident response procedures for data breaches

### 5. Implementation & Change Management
- Develop phased implementation plan with clear milestones
- Design training programs for data stewards and end users
- Establish data quality monitoring and continuous improvement processes
- Create communication plan for stakeholder engagement
