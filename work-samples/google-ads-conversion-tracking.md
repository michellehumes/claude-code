# Google Ads & Conversion Tracking Work Sample

## Overview

This document provides a sample summary of my typical workflow when setting up Google Ads pixels and conversion tracking for digital products and ecommerce clients.

## Key Steps

### 1. Audit Existing Setup
- Verify that the Google Ads pixel and GA4 tags are installed correctly on all pages
- Ensure Google Tag Manager is configured to fire tags in the correct order
- Review existing conversion actions and their attribution settings

### 2. Define Conversion Events
- Set up primary conversion events such as Purchase, Lead, and Add-to-Cart
- Configure event parameters to capture values like transaction amount and product ID
- Establish conversion windows and counting methods appropriate for the business model

### 3. Implement Stripe-Based Tracking
- Use Stripe webhooks to capture purchase events directly from the payment processor
- Send conversion data to Google Ads to improve attribution accuracy
- Configure server-side tracking for reliable conversion measurement

### 4. Test & Validate
- Use Tag Assistant and real-time reporting to validate that events fire as expected
- Troubleshoot any misfiring or duplicate events
- Verify conversion values are being passed correctly

### 5. Reporting & Optimization
- Set up custom reports in GA4 to monitor funnel drop-off
- Use conversion data to optimize ad targeting and bidding strategies
- Create dashboards for ongoing performance monitoring
