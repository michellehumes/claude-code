- Mood changes

## Quick Reference: Business Operations

### Profitability Analysis

**Product Level:**
```
Margin % = ((Price - Cost) / Price) × 100

Example:
Water bottle: $34.99 price, $12.50 cost
Margin = ((34.99 - 12.50) / 34.99) × 100 = 64.3%
```

**Order Level:**
```
True Profit = Revenue - COGS - Platform Fees - Shipping - Ad Spend

Example Etsy order:
Revenue: $69.98 (2 bottles × $34.99)
COGS: $25.00 (2 × $12.50)
Etsy fee: $4.20 (6% of revenue)
Shipping: $8.50
Ad spend: $5.00
True Profit = $69.98 - $25.00 - $4.20 - $8.50 - $5.00 = $27.28
```

### Inventory Management

**Reorder Point:**
```
Average weekly sales × Lead time in weeks + Safety stock

Example:
Avg weekly sales: 5 bottles
Lead time: 2 weeks
Safety stock: 5 bottles
Reorder at: (5 × 2) + 5 = 15 bottles
```
