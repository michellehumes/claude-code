                <p>Setting up your first home workshop is one of the most rewarding investments you can make as a homeowner. A well-organized workspace saves you money on repairs and projects you would otherwise hire out, and it gives you a dedicated place to build, create, and fix things at your own pace. But where do you start?</p>

                <p>I have helped over a dozen friends and family members set up their first workshops, and the questions are always the same: How much space do I need? What tools should I buy first? How should I arrange everything? How much is this going to cost? This guide answers all of those questions with specific, practical advice based on my experience building workshops in garages, basements, spare bedrooms, and even a 6x8-foot garden shed.</p>

                <!-- Quick Answer -->
                <div class="quick-answer" id="quick-answer">
                    <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
                    <p>You can set up a functional beginner workshop in as little as <strong>80 square feet</strong> (an 8x10 section of a garage) for around <strong>$500</strong>. The five tools you need first are a cordless drill/driver, an impact driver, a circular saw, a jigsaw, and a random orbital sander. Add a sturdy workbench, basic hand tools, and proper lighting, and you can tackle 90% of home improvement projects. A full workshop with all the essentials runs $1,000-$2,000 depending on brand choice and whether you buy new or take advantage of sales.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Choosing Your Space -->
                <h2 id="choosing-space">Choosing Your Workshop Space</h2>

                <p>The ideal workshop space varies by situation, but here are the most common options with their pros, cons, and practical considerations.</p>

                <h3>Garage Workshop</h3>
                <p>The most popular choice for good reason. A two-car garage offers 400-500 square feet, and even dedicating one bay (200-250 sq ft) to a workshop gives you ample space. Garages have concrete floors that handle spills and mess, large doors for material delivery and ventilation, and existing electrical service. The tradeoff is sharing space with vehicles, which means either compromising on workshop size or parking outside.</p>

                <p><strong>Minimum viable space:</strong> 8x10 feet (80 sq ft) along one wall, with the workbench against the back wall and wall-mounted storage above. This is tight but workable for a basic tool setup and small projects.</p>

                <p><strong>Ideal space:</strong> 12x20 feet (240 sq ft) or a full single-car bay. This gives you room for a workbench, a table saw or miter saw station, material storage, and comfortable walking space around your work.</p>

                <h3>Basement Workshop</h3>
                <p>Basements offer climate control, protection from weather, and separation from living spaces. However, getting large materials and tools down the stairs can be a challenge, dust management is critical (basement dust can enter the home's HVAC system), and moisture can be an issue. If your basement stays dry and you can manage the stairs, it is an excellent workshop location, especially for fine woodworking and electronics work where temperature and humidity control matter.</p>

                <h3>Shed or Outbuilding</h3>
                <p>A dedicated shed (10x12 feet minimum, 12x16 feet ideal) gives you a purpose-built workshop with no space compromises. The downsides are cost (a quality shed or building runs $2,000-$8,000 before any interior improvements), the need for electrical service to be run from the house, and lack of climate control unless you add insulation and HVAC. For serious hobbyists who want a dedicated space, a shed workshop is the ultimate solution.</p>

                <h3>Spare Room or Enclosed Porch</h3>
                <p>For apartment dwellers or those without garage or basement access, a spare bedroom or enclosed porch can work for light-duty tasks like electronics, small woodworking, and general repairs. Focus on cordless tools (no need for heavy electrical), portable workbenches, and meticulous dust control. This is not ideal for noisy or dusty work, but it is better than no workshop at all.</p>

                <div class="callout-box callout-pro-tip">
                    <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                    <p>Before committing to a space, spend a weekend doing a project in that area with minimal setup. You will quickly discover issues like poor lighting, limited outlet access, awkward traffic patterns, or noise complaints from family members that are not obvious until you actually work in the space. This trial run will inform your layout decisions and save you from expensive mistakes.</p>

                <!-- Essential Power Tools -->
                <h2 id="essential-power-tools">Essential Power Tools</h2>

                <p>Here are the five power tools I recommend buying first, in order of priority. These five tools will handle 90% of home improvement and DIY projects.</p>

                <h3>1. Cordless Drill/Driver</h3>
                <p>The single most-used tool in any workshop. You will reach for this multiple times a week for everything from hanging pictures to assembling furniture to installing cabinet hardware. A cordless drill/driver drills holes (with drill bits) and drives screws (with driver bits), making it the Swiss Army knife of power tools.</p>

                <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Brushless motor, at least 400 in-lbs of torque, 2-speed gearbox (low speed for driving, high speed for drilling), a 1/2-inch keyless chuck, and a built-in LED work light. Buy a model that comes with at least two batteries so you always have a charged spare.</p>

                <h3>2. Cordless Impact Driver</h3>
                <p>An impact driver looks similar to a drill but uses a rotational hammering action to drive fasteners with much more torque and less user fatigue. For driving deck screws, lag bolts, long screws into hardwood, and any fastener that would stall a drill, the impact driver is the right tool. It is also lighter and more compact than a drill, making it easier to use in tight spaces.</p>

                <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> 1,500+ in-lbs of torque, 1/4-inch hex quick-connect chuck, multi-speed modes (some tasks need less torque to avoid overdriving), and compatibility with your drill's battery platform.</p>

                <h3>3. Circular Saw</h3>
                <p>When you need to cut plywood, lumber, or sheet goods, the circular saw is your go-to tool. A 7-1/4" circular saw can cut through 2x material in a single pass and handles sheet goods with ease when paired with a straightedge guide. It is also the most cost-effective way to make straight cuts without investing in a table saw.</p>

                <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> 7-1/4" blade for maximum cutting depth, at least 5,200 RPM, an electric brake (stops the blade when you release the trigger), and a magnesium or aluminum shoe plate (lighter and more durable than stamped steel). For cordless models, make sure it is compatible with your existing battery platform.</p>

                <h3>4. Jigsaw</h3>
                <p>A jigsaw cuts curves, circles, and irregular shapes that a circular saw cannot. It is the tool you need for cutting sink openings in countertops, trimming door bottoms, cutting curves in plywood for shelving projects, and making plunge cuts. With the right blade, a jigsaw cuts wood, metal, plastic, and even ceramic tile.</p>

                <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Variable speed trigger, orbital action (adjustable aggressiveness), tool-free blade change, and a dust blower to keep your cut line visible. Cordless jigsaws have improved enormously in recent years and are now fully adequate for home use.</p>

                <h3>5. Random Orbital Sander</h3>
                <p>You will sand more than you think. Every painted surface, every cut edge, every piece of furniture you refinish needs sanding. A random orbital sander uses a 5-inch round pad that spins and oscillates simultaneously, creating a swirl-free finish. It is dramatically faster and more consistent than hand sanding.</p>

                <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Variable speed (2,000-12,000 OPM), a dust collection port that connects to a shop vacuum, a hook-and-loop pad for easy sandpaper changes, and a comfortable low-vibration grip. This is one tool where corded models still have a clear advantage for sustained sanding sessions.</p>

                <!-- Essential Hand Tools -->
                <h2 id="essential-hand-tools">Essential Hand Tools</h2>

                <p>Power tools get the glory, but hand tools are the backbone of every workshop. Here is the complete hand tool starter set you should acquire before or alongside your first power tools.</p>

                <h3>Measuring and Marking</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tape Measure (25 ft):</strong> Stanley FatMax or Milwaukee 25 ft. Get a quality tape with a wide (1-1/4") blade that stands out without support. You will use this more than any other tool.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combination Square (12"):</strong> Essential for marking 90-degree and 45-degree lines, checking squareness, and measuring depth. The Swanson Speed Square is an inexpensive alternative for rough framing work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Torpedo Level (9") and 24" Level:</strong> For ensuring shelves, pictures, and installations are level and plumb.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pencils and Utility Knife:</strong> Keep a dozen carpenter's pencils on hand (they roll off surfaces less than round pencils). A retractable utility knife with replaceable blades is the most-used cutting tool in any shop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stud Finder:</strong> Electronic stud finder for locating framing behind drywall. Essential for hanging heavy items securely.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cutting and Shaping</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Handsaw:</strong> A Japanese-style pull saw (like the Suizan Ryoba) cuts on the pull stroke for more control and leaves a thinner kerf. Keep one for cuts where a power saw is overkill or too cumbersome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hacksaw:</strong> For cutting metal pipe, bolts, and hardware. A 12-inch frame with 24-TPI blade handles most home cutting tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chisels (set of 4):</strong> 1/4", 1/2", 3/4", and 1" wood chisels for mortising hinges, cleaning up joints, and removing small amounts of material. The Narex set offers excellent quality at a beginner-friendly price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Block Plane:</strong> For trimming doors, chamfering edges, and fine-tuning joints. A low-angle block plane like the Stanley 12-960 is versatile and inexpensive.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fastening and Holding</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hammer (16 oz curved claw):</strong> For driving and pulling nails. A fiberglass or steel handle absorbs vibration better than wood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Screwdriver Set:</strong> Phillips #1, #2, and #3; flat head in 3/16", 1/4", and 5/16". Or save money and space with a multi-bit screwdriver like the Megapro 15-in-1.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pliers Set:</strong> Needle-nose, tongue-and-groove (Channellock style), and linesman pliers cover most gripping, pulling, and cutting needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjustable Wrench (2-pack):</strong> 8" and 12" adjustable wrenches handle most bolt sizes without needing a full wrench set.</li>
                    <li><strong>Allen Key Set (metric and SAE):</strong> For furniture assembly, bicycle repair, and countless fasteners that use hex sockets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clamps (4-6 minimum):</strong> Quick-grip bar clamps (two 12" and two 24") are the most versatile starting set. You will eventually want many more. The saying "you can never have too many clamps" is absolutely true.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Safety Equipment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Safety Glasses:</strong> ANSI Z87.1-rated glasses. Keep multiple pairs around the shop so there is never an excuse not to wear them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hearing Protection:</strong> Foam earplugs (NRR 32) for quick tasks, over-ear muffs (NRR 25+) for extended work. Power tools regularly exceed 85 dB, the threshold for hearing damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dust Masks/Respirator:</strong> N95 disposable masks for general sawdust. A half-face respirator with P100 filters for sanding, painting, and working with treated lumber or composites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work Gloves:</strong> Leather or synthetic work gloves for handling rough materials. Never wear gloves when using rotating tools (drills, lathes, grinders) as they can catch and pull your hand into the tool.</li>
                    <li><strong>First Aid Kit:</strong> A well-stocked kit kept in a visible, accessible location. Include a tourniquet, hemostatic gauze, and butterfly closures in addition to standard bandages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fire Extinguisher:</strong> ABC-rated, minimum 5 lb. Mount it near the workshop exit, not behind the workbench.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Workbench Options -->
                <h2 id="workbench">Workbench Options</h2>

                <p>Your workbench is the heart of your workshop. It is where you measure, cut, assemble, finish, and repair. A good workbench needs to be sturdy (it should not wobble or flex when you push on it), at the right height (your palms should rest flat on the surface with arms relaxed, typically 34-38 inches), and large enough for your typical projects (minimum 24" deep and 48" wide).</p>

                <h3>Option 1: Buy a Pre-Made Workbench</h3>
                <p>The fastest path to a functional workshop. Pre-made workbenches range from $150 for a basic steel-frame bench to $800+ for a hardwood cabinetmaker's bench. For most beginners, a mid-range bench with a solid top and built-in storage is the sweet spot.</p>

                <h3>Option 2: Build Your Own Workbench</h3>
                <p>Building your own workbench is a fantastic first project. It teaches fundamental skills (measuring, cutting, fastening) and gives you a bench customized to your space and needs. The classic 2x4-and-plywood workbench can be built for under $100 in materials and requires only a circular saw, a drill, and a few hours.</p>

                <p><strong>Simple 2x4 Workbench Bill of Materials:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>8x 2x4x8' studs (legs, stretchers, and frame) - $4 each</li>
                    <li>1x 3/4" plywood sheet 4x8' (top and shelf) - $45</li>
                    <li>Box of 3" construction screws - $8</li>
                    <li>Box of 2-1/2" construction screws - $8</li>
                    <li>Wood glue - $6</li>
                    <li><strong>Total: approximately $100</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>The resulting bench will be 48-72" wide, 24" deep, and whatever height you choose. It will not be pretty, but it will be incredibly strong and perfectly functional. You can always refine it later by adding a hardboard top for a smooth surface, a front vise for clamping, or pegboard on the back for tool storage.</p>

                <h3>Option 3: Portable Workbench</h3>
                <p>If space is extremely limited, a portable folding workbench like the Kreg Mobile Project Center or the Black+Decker Workmate 425 provides a stable work surface that folds flat for storage. These are not replacements for a proper workbench, but they are a viable starting point for apartment dwellers or those working in shared spaces.</p>

                <!-- Layout Tips -->
                <h2 id="layout">Workshop Layout Tips</h2>

                <p>Good workshop layout makes everything more efficient and safer. These principles apply regardless of your space size.</p>

                <h3>1. Position the Workbench First</h3>
                <p>Your workbench is the primary work surface, so place it first and arrange everything else around it. Ideally, position the bench where it gets the most natural light (near a window) and has electrical outlets within reach. You should be able to walk around at least three sides of the bench. If the bench must go against a wall, place the long side against the wall so you still have access from both ends.</p>

                <h3>2. Create Work Zones</h3>
                <p>Organize your shop into distinct zones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assembly Zone:</strong> Centered on the workbench. Keep your most-used hand tools within arm's reach (pegboard behind the bench is perfect). This is where you measure, mark, assemble, and do detailed work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cutting Zone:</strong> Where you use the circular saw, miter saw, or table saw. Place this near the garage door or shop entrance for easy material handling and sawdust cleanup. Ensure there is enough infeed and outfeed space for long boards (at least 4 feet on each side of a miter saw).</li>
                    <li><strong>Finishing Zone:</strong> Sanding, painting, and staining. Ideally, this area has good ventilation (near a window or exhaust fan) and is separated from electronics and clean storage to avoid dust contamination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage Zone:</strong> Materials, supplies, and tools not currently in use. Place this along walls and in corners to keep floor space clear for working.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Plan for Material Handling</h3>
                <p>Think about how you will get a full sheet of plywood (4x8 feet) from your vehicle into your shop and onto your work surface. Ensure there is a clear path from the entrance to the cutting area. If your shop is tight, consider a sheet goods cart or a wall-mounted plywood storage rack that keeps sheets vertical and accessible.</p>

                <h3>4. Keep Floors Clear</h3>
                <p>Everything that can go on a wall or hang from the ceiling should go on a wall or hang from the ceiling. Floor space is your most precious resource. Use wall-mounted French cleat systems, pegboard, magnetic tool bars, and overhead storage to maximize usable floor area. Keep a clear path to the exit at all times for safety.</p>

                <h3>5. Prioritize Lighting</h3>
                <p>Poor lighting causes mistakes and eye strain. Aim for 50-75 foot-candles of general illumination (equivalent to about 100 watts of LED per 100 square feet). Use 4-foot LED shop lights mounted across the ceiling. Add a task light on your workbench for detailed work. Cool white (4,000-5,000K) LEDs provide the best color rendering for seeing detail in wood grain, paint color, and fine measurements.</p>

                <div class="callout-box callout-pro-tip">
                    <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                    <p>Install lighting before anything else in your shop. Working in poor light while setting up the rest of your workshop is frustrating and dangerous. A pair of 4-foot LED shop lights costs under $30 and makes everything else easier. Mount them parallel to your workbench, directly above your primary work area, for shadow-free illumination.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Electrical Requirements -->
                <h2 id="electrical">Electrical Requirements</h2>

                <p>Insufficient electrical service is the most common workshop problem that people do not plan for. Here is what you need to know.</p>

                <h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>
                <p>A basic home workshop needs at least two dedicated 20-amp, 120V circuits. One circuit for your workbench area (lights, chargers, and hand-held tools) and one for power tools in the cutting area (circular saw, miter saw, shop vacuum). If you are using a garage that has only one 15-amp circuit (common in older homes), you will trip breakers constantly when running a table saw or shop vacuum. Adding a dedicated circuit is a $200-$400 electrician visit that is absolutely worth the investment.</p>

                <h3>Ideal Setup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Circuit 1:</strong> 20A/120V for workbench, lighting, and charging station</li>
                    <li><strong>Circuit 2:</strong> 20A/120V for portable power tools (circular saw, router, sander)</li>
                    <li><strong>Circuit 3:</strong> 20A/120V for shop vacuum and dust collection</li>
                    <li><strong>Circuit 4 (optional):</strong> 20A/240V for a table saw, large compressor, or welder</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Install GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protection on all workshop circuits. This is code-required in garages and basements in most jurisdictions and protects you from electrical shock in a damp environment.</p>

                <h3>Outlet Placement</h3>
                <p>Place outlets every 6 feet along the walls at workbench height (42 inches above the floor) in addition to standard floor-level outlets. Having outlets at the right height eliminates the need for extension cords draped across the floor, which are trip hazards and safety risks. A retractable cord reel mounted on the ceiling is also extremely useful for providing power to the center of the shop without floor cords.</p>

                <div class="callout-box callout-pro-tip">
                    <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                    <p>If you are using cordless tools (and you should be for most tasks), set up a dedicated battery charging station on its own circuit. A shelf or wall-mounted organizer near the shop entrance with chargers for your battery platform keeps batteries organized, charged, and ready to go. Label charger positions with the battery Ah rating so you always grab the right battery for the task.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Storage Solutions -->
                <h2 id="storage">Storage Solutions</h2>

                <p>Good storage is the difference between a workshop you love using and one you avoid because you can never find anything. Here are the most effective storage solutions for a home workshop.</p>

                <h3>French Cleat Wall</h3>
                <p>A French cleat system uses interlocking 45-degree beveled strips of plywood to create infinitely reconfigurable wall storage. You make cleats from 3/4" plywood ripped at 45 degrees on a table saw, mount horizontal strips on the wall, and hang custom holders for every tool you own. The beauty of the system is that you can rearrange everything in seconds as your tool collection grows. This is the single best workshop storage investment you can make, and the materials cost under $50 for an entire wall.</p>

                <h3>Pegboard</h3>
                <p>The classic workshop storage solution. A 4x8 sheet of 1/4" pegboard costs under $20 and provides instant hang-anything storage for hand tools. Mount it with 3/4" spacers behind the board so hooks can engage properly. Outline your tools with a marker so you always know where things go and can immediately see if something is missing.</p>

                <h3>Overhead Storage</h3>
                <p>The ceiling is wasted space in most workshops. Overhead storage racks (like the SafeRacks or Fleximounts ceiling-mounted systems) hold seasonal items, rarely-used tools, and bulk materials. A 4x8 overhead rack can hold 400-600 lbs of storage and costs $100-$200 installed. Just make sure your ceiling framing can support the weight and that stored items are above head height (minimum 7 feet from the floor).</p>

                <h3>Small Parts Organization</h3>
                <p>Screws, nails, bolts, drill bits, and small hardware need organized storage. Options include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parts organizer boxes:</strong> Stackable plastic boxes with adjustable compartments (like the DeWalt TSTAK or Milwaukee PACKOUT organizers)</li>
                    <li><strong>Mason jar wall:</strong> Screw mason jar lids to the underside of a shelf, fill jars with small parts, and screw the jars into the lids. Classic, cheap, and you can see exactly what is in each jar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetic strips:</strong> Mount magnetic tool bars on the wall for bits, sockets, wrenches, and any small metal items. Keeps them visible and accessible.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Budget Tiers -->
                <h2 id="budget-tiers">Budget Tiers: $500 / $1,000 / $2,000</h2>

                    <p>Do not buy everything at once. Start with Tier 1 and add tools as specific projects demand them. You will learn what you actually need through experience, and you will avoid buying tools that sit unused. Many experienced woodworkers admit that half the tools they bought early on were unnecessary purchases driven by YouTube videos and tool envy rather than actual need. Let your projects drive your tool purchases.</p>

                <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-section">
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much space do I need for a workshop?</h3>
                        <p>The absolute minimum is about 80 square feet (8x10 feet), which gives you space for a workbench and basic tools along one wall. A comfortable single-person workshop is 150-250 square feet. A well-equipped workshop with a table saw, miter saw station, and assembly area needs 300-500 square feet. Work with what you have and optimize the layout using the zone approach described above.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should I insulate and heat my garage workshop?</h3>
                        <p>If you live in a climate with cold winters and plan to use the workshop year-round, insulating at least the walls and ceiling is worth the investment. Insulation also helps with noise reduction (your neighbors will appreciate this). For heating, a 240V electric garage heater (like the Fahrenheat FUH54) is the safest option for a workshop because it has no open flame, requires no venting, and heats a two-car garage effectively. Cost: $150-$300 for the heater plus $200-$400 for an electrician to install a 240V circuit.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is the first project I should build in my new workshop?</h3>
                        <p>Build your workbench first if you went the DIY route. After that, simple shelving (wall-mounted or freestanding) is the perfect second project. It teaches measuring, cutting, and fastening while producing something immediately useful. A basic set of garage shelves using 2x4 frames and 3/4" plywood shelves can be built in an afternoon and costs under $60 in materials.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do I control dust in a home workshop?</h3>
                        <p>Dust control has three levels. First, capture dust at the source using a shop vacuum connected to your tools (most modern power tools have dust ports). Second, filter airborne dust with a workshop air filtration unit (a box fan with a furnace filter strapped to it is a surprisingly effective budget option). Third, clean up regularly and never let sawdust accumulate because it is a fire hazard and a respiratory irritant. For serious woodworkers, a dedicated dust collection system ($200-$500) connected to your table saw and miter saw is a worthwhile investment.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I set up a workshop in a rental property?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, with some considerations. Avoid permanent modifications (electrical work, wall mounting, built-in storage) unless your landlord approves. Use freestanding workbenches, portable storage, and tools that do not require dedicated circuits. A folding workbench, cordless tools, and a set of freestanding shelves give you a functional workshop that you can disassemble and move when your lease ends.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do I need a table saw?</h3>
                        <p>Not right away. A circular saw with a straightedge guide can make the same rip cuts and crosscuts that a table saw makes, just slower and with slightly less precision. A table saw becomes valuable when you do regular woodworking that requires repeated precise cuts: building furniture, making cabinets, or doing trim work. For general home improvement, a circular saw and a miter saw cover 95% of cutting needs.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do I make my workshop safe for kids?</h3>
                        <p>If children have access to your workshop, take these precautions: lock all power tools away or unplug/remove batteries when not in use; store sharp tools (chisels, utility knives, saw blades) in closed drawers or locked cabinets; lock up chemicals (paint, solvents, glues); install a lock on the workshop door or entry; and establish a firm rule that children are never in the workshop without direct adult supervision. Consider motion-sensor alarms on the workshop entry as an additional safeguard.</p>

                        <h3>Shelzy Perkins</h3>
                        <p>Shelzy has set up workshops in five different homes over the past 15 years, ranging from a cramped apartment balcony to a purpose-built 400 square-foot detached shop. He has helped friends and family set up over a dozen home workshops and has made (and learned from) every mistake in this guide. His current workshop occupies a two-car garage bay with a French cleat wall, a 6-foot workbench, and far too many clamps.</p>
