# Pricing Tiers & Revenue Architecture

## Pricing Philosophy

Price on **perceived value**, not production cost. Digital products have near-zero marginal cost. Every pricing decision should answer: "What is this worth to the buyer in their emotional context?"

## Pricing Psychology Tactics

### Anchoring

Always show the perceived value comparison:

```
Comparable retail value: $400+
Individual purchase equivalent: $350+
YOUR PRICE: $49
```

### Decoy Pricing

Structure tiers so Standard is the obvious "best deal":

```
Lite:     $19  (12 pieces = $1.58/piece)
Standard: $49  (35 pieces = $1.40/piece) ← BEST VALUE
Premium:  $79  (55 pieces = $1.44/piece)
```

The Lite is intentionally poor value-per-piece. Premium and Standard are close in per-piece cost, making Standard the obvious smart buy, while Premium captures those who "want it all."

### Price Ending

- Use $X9 pricing ($19, $29, $39, $49, $59, $69, $79)
- Never $X0 or $X5 — less conversion-effective on Etsy
- Exception: Mega bundles can use $99, $129, $149, $199

### Sale Pricing

| Event | Discount | Frequency |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Launch | 25% off | Once per SKU (first 2 weeks) |
| Black Friday / Cyber Monday | 30% off | Annually |
| Valentine's Day (relationship verticals) | 20% off | Annually |
| Etsy Sales Events | 15% off | When Etsy promotes |
| Pet Memorial Day (September) | 15% off | Annually |
| Seasonal transitions | 20% off | Quarterly |

**Rule for Pet Memorial:** Never run aggressive sales. 15% maximum. No urgency language. No "flash sales." Respect the emotional context.
