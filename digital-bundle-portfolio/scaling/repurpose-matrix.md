# Repurpose Matrix: Structure Reuse Across Verticals

## Core Principle

Every bundle is built on a reusable structural skeleton. When creating a new theme variation, identify which components are **structural** (reusable) vs. **thematic** (must change). This matrix maps the reuse potential across every vertical.
