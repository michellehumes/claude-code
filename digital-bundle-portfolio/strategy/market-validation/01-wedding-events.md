# Market Validation: Wedding & Event Bundles

## Selected Sub-Niche

**Coastal Wedding Weekend Kit**

A full suite of coordinated printable assets for a destination or beach-themed wedding weekend — from welcome bags to rehearsal dinners to the ceremony itself.

## Target Buyer Persona

- **Age:** 26–38
- **Gender:** Predominantly female (bride or maid of honor)
- **Income:** Upper-middle ($80K–$150K household)
- **Behavior:** Plans 6–12 months in advance. Searches Pinterest and Etsy simultaneously. Values cohesion over individual pieces. Willing to pay premium for "done-for-you" aesthetic systems.
- **Pain Point:** Cannot find a single, cohesive set that covers the entire wedding weekend. Buys piecemeal and wastes hours trying to match fonts, colors, and styles.
- **Emotional Driver:** Wants guests to feel the experience is curated, personal, and elevated — without hiring a full stationer.

## Competitive Gap

- **What exists:** Individual wedding templates (invitations, menus, programs). Some 5–10 piece "suites." Highly saturated invitation-only market.
- **What's missing:** Comprehensive 30–50 piece wedding *weekend* kits covering welcome bags, itineraries, rehearsal dinner, ceremony, reception, and post-wedding brunch in a single cohesive design language.
- **Opportunity:** Position as "complete wedding weekend stationery system" — not a template shop. Competitors sell pieces. We sell the full experience.

## Pricing Opportunity

| Tier | Assets | Price |
|------|--------|-------|
| Lite | 12–15 pieces (ceremony essentials) | $29 |
| Standard | 30–35 pieces (full wedding day + welcome) | $49 |
| Premium | 50–60 pieces (entire weekend + social templates) | $79 |

- Average competitor single-template price: $8–$15
- Average competitor small suite: $25–$35
- Our premium bundle at $79 undercuts hiring a stationer ($500–$2,000+) by 95%+ while delivering more than any competing Etsy bundle

## Seasonal Timing Advantage

- **Peak demand:** January–April (engagement season → wedding planning begins)
- **Secondary peak:** September–October (fall weddings planned 6+ months out, but last-minute planners search here)
- **Evergreen floor:** Year-round destination weddings sustain baseline
- **Launch window:** Optimal to list by late February/March to catch spring planning surge
