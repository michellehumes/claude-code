# Market Validation: Relationship / Anniversary Kits

## Selected Sub-Niche

**Couples Anniversary Memory Book & Experience Kit**

A printable anniversary celebration system — memory book pages, love letter templates, milestone trackers, date night cards, and a "12-month relationship challenge" add-on.

## Target Buyer Persona

- **Age:** 25–45
- **Gender:** Mixed, slight female skew (often purchased as a gift or experience to share)
- **Income:** Middle to upper-middle ($55K–$120K household)
- **Behavior:** Searches 1–4 weeks before anniversary. Looking for something more meaningful than a physical gift. Values personalization, sentimentality, and shared experiences. Often searching "unique anniversary gift" or "anniversary gift for him/her."
- **Pain Point:** Tired of generic gifts. Wants something personal and experiential but lacks creative ability or time to make a scrapbook or plan dates from scratch. Physical memory books are expensive ($30–$60) and take days to ship.
- **Emotional Driver:** Celebrating love, connection, and shared history. Wants the partner to feel truly seen and valued. The product is a vehicle for expressing love.

## Competitive Gap

- **What exists:** Basic anniversary cards ($3–$8). Simple journal prompts ($10–$15). Physical memory books ($30–$60, limited customization). "Open When" letter sets (popular but usually just envelopes).
- **What's missing:** Comprehensive anniversary experience kits that combine a memory book, love letters, milestone celebration, AND ongoing engagement (date nights, challenges). Most digital options are thin — a single journal or card. Nobody offers the full emotional experience as a system.
- **Opportunity:** Position as an "anniversary experience kit" — not just a card or journal, but a complete celebration system that extends the moment into an ongoing shared practice.

## Pricing Opportunity

| Tier | Assets | Price |
|------|--------|-------|
| Lite | 10–12 pieces (memory pages + letter templates) | $19 |
| Standard | 25–30 pieces (full memory book + date nights) | $39 |
| Premium | 40–50 pieces (full kit + 12-month challenge) | $59 |

- Physical anniversary books: $30–$60 (slow shipping, not customizable)
- Digital journals/prompts: $10–$15 (thin, incomplete)
- Our $39 Standard delivers 25+ assets combining memory, letters, and experiences
- The $59 Premium with 12-month challenge has strong upsell logic

## Seasonal Timing Advantage

- **Peak demand:** January–February (Valentine's Day), June (wedding anniversary cluster month), December (year-end reflection)
- **Valentine's crossover:** This vertical has direct Valentine's Day relevance — can be positioned as "the Valentine's gift that lasts all year"
- **Evergreen base:** Anniversaries happen every month
- **Launch strategy:** List before Valentine's Day for maximum initial exposure
