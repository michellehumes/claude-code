A: Yes. The cover page, tribute print, and several other pieces are editable via Canva (free account). Detailed instructions included.

**Q: Is this only for dogs?**
A: This kit is designed with dog-specific language ("paw print," "walks," etc.). We also offer Cat Memorial, Horse Memorial, and Universal Pet Memorial versions — check our shop.

**Q: Can I print this as a bound book?**
A: Yes. Print all memory book pages single-sided and bind with a spiral binding, 3-ring binder, or take to a print shop for booklet binding. Our included guide has binding recommendations.

A: Yes. Many buyers purchase this as a sympathy gift. You can forward the download link or print the materials and assemble them as a care package. Our Premium tier includes a Care Package Checklist with ideas.
