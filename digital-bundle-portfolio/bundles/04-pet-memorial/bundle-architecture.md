## Sympathy Gift Positioning

**Key Insight:** Many buyers will purchase this kit not for themselves, but as a gift for a friend or family member experiencing pet loss.

Marketing angles:
1. "The most thoughtful pet loss gift you can give — delivered instantly"
2. "Send comfort in minutes, not days"
3. "A beautiful tribute kit for the dog owner in your life who's hurting"

This doubles the buyer pool: grieving owner + sympathetic friend/family.

## Expandable SKU Logic

Same 40-piece structure → swap for different pets:

| Variation | Subject | Adjustment |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Cat Memorial Kit | Cat-specific language | Swap paw print style, "favorite perch" etc. |
| Horse Memorial Kit | Equine-specific | Larger format options, barn/field imagery |
| Small Pet Memorial | Rabbit, hamster, bird | Smaller scale, gentler language |
| Multi-Pet Memorial | General | Non-species-specific language |
| Rainbow Bridge Collection | All pets | Universal, emphasizes "bridge" theme |

Each variation reuses 75% structure — highest reuse rate of all verticals.
