## FAQ Section

**Q: Is this for a specific anniversary year?**
A: No. The cover page is editable — add any year, any milestone. Works for 1 year or 25 years.

**Q: Can a man use this? Is it gender-neutral?**
A: Yes. The design is intentionally gender-neutral — warm tones, no overly feminine elements. The language uses "partner" and is inclusive of all couple types.

**Q: How do the "Open When" letters work?**
A: You write personalized letters for 8 scenarios ("Open When You're Sad," "Open When You Miss Me," etc.). Each letter has guided prompts to help you write. Seal in the included printable envelopes. Your partner opens them when the moment arises.

**Q: What's the 12-Month Relationship Challenge?**
A: A structured year-long journey with monthly themes (gratitude, adventure, vulnerability, etc.), weekly micro-challenges, and end-of-month reflection cards. It's designed to deepen your connection over 12 months. Think of it as a relationship growth system, not homework.

**Q: Can I print just parts of this?**
A: Absolutely. Print only what resonates. Use the memory book now, save date night cards for later. It's your kit to use your way.
