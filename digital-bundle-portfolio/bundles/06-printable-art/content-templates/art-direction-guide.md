## Color Coordination Rules

1. **Adjacent prints in any gallery arrangement should not duplicate the dominant color**
2. **Every grouping should include at least one warm and one cool neutral**
3. **Typography prints pair best with botanical or abstract — not other typography**
4. **Landscape prints work best as anchors, flanked by smaller abstract or botanical pieces**
5. **The styling guide includes 6 pre-designed gallery arrangements with specific print recommendations**
