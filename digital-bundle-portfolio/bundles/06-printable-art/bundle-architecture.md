## Design Specifications

### Color Palette (Across All Prints)

All prints must fall within this unified palette range:

- **Warm Neutrals:** Cream (#F5ECD7), Sand (#DDD0BC), Linen (#E8DFD0)
- **Earth Tones:** Warm Taupe (#B5A18E), Terracotta (#C2805A), Olive (#8B8B6B)
- **Cool Neutrals:** Sage (#A8B5A0), Dusty Blue (#9AACB8), Warm Gray (#B0AAA0)
- **Darks:** Charcoal (#454545), Espresso (#3D3028), Deep Olive (#4A4F3F)
- **Accent:** Muted Gold (#C4A55A) — used sparingly in select prints

**Rule:** No primary colors. No neon. No black-and-white stark contrast. Every print should feel warm, organic, and cohesive when placed next to any other print in the collection.

### Typography (For Quote/Typography Prints)
- Primary: Modern Serif (Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond)
- Secondary: Thin Sans-Serif (Jost Thin, Raleway Light)
- Accent: Hand-lettered feel for select pieces
- No novelty fonts. No overly decorative typefaces.

### Art Style Guidelines
- **Botanicals:** Watercolor or pencil illustration style, not photographic
- **Abstracts:** Organic shapes, brush strokes, watercolor washes — never geometric-only
- **Landscapes:** Minimalist, muted, painterly — not photographic
- **Line Art:** Continuous line or minimal stroke — elegant, never busy
- **Typography:** Generous white space, intentional composition

### File Specifications
- **Resolution:** 300 DPI minimum for all sizes
- **Color Profile:** sRGB (for home/online printing) + CMYK variant (for professional printing)
- **File Format:** PDF and JPG for each print
- **Bleed:** 0.125" bleed on all prints
- **Naming Convention:** `NeutralGallery_[Category]_[Number]_[Size].pdf`

| 4:5 | 8x10, 16x20 | Most common frame sizes |
| 11:14 | 11x14 | Mid-size gallery |
| 2:3 | 16x24, 24x36 | Statement/oversized |
| 1:1 | 8x8, 10x10, 12x12 | Square frames |
| 5:4 (horizontal) | 10x8, 14x11, 20x16 | Horizontal/landscape display |

## Seasonal Variation Logic

Same structural framework → different aesthetic collections:

| Season | Collection Name | Palette Shift |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Spring | "Fresh Bloom" Gallery Pack | Soft green, peach, lavender, white |
| Summer | "Coastal Calm" Gallery Pack | Ocean blue, sand, driftwood, white |
| Autumn | "Harvest Glow" Gallery Pack | Amber, rust, deep olive, cream |
| Winter | "Quiet Winter" Gallery Pack | Cool gray, ice blue, pine, warm white |

**Execution:** Create 30 new seasonal prints per collection (reuse 90 core prints that are seasonless) = 4 seasonal variations with minimal additional production.

---

## Expandable SKU Logic

| Variation | Focus | Unique Selling Point |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Minimalist Affirmation Set | Typography only, 50 prints | Mental health / wellness angle |
| Coastal Beach Collection | Ocean/beach themed | Beach house, coastal living rooms |
| Vintage Botanical Pack | Scientific illustration style | Botanical garden aesthetic |
| Dark & Moody Collection | Deep tones, dramatic | Masculine / studio / library aesthetic |
| Nursery Art Collection | Soft, child-friendly animals | New parent market crossover |

Each variation reuses 50% guide content. Art assets are new but follow identical size/format specs.
