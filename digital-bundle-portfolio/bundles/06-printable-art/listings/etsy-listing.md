## FAQ Section

**Q: How many prints will I actually use?**
A: Most customers display 10–30 prints and rotate others seasonally. The collection gives you enough options to style every room in your home — and change your gallery wall whenever you want without buying more.

**Q: What's the best paper to print these on?**
A: Matte photo paper for the best results. Heavy cardstock also works. Our included Print Quality Guide has paper weight, finish, and printer setting recommendations for every piece.

**Q: Can I print these at a professional service?**
A: Yes. All files are 300 DPI and print-ready. Upload to Walmart, Costco, Shutterfly, or any online print service. Our guide includes recommendations.

**Q: What frames should I use?**
A: Our Framing Guide covers this in detail. Short answer: thin natural wood for botanicals, thin black metal for line art, warm gold for abstracts. Mix frame styles for a collected look.

**Q: Are the large format prints (24x36) really print quality?**
A: Yes. All prints are created at 300 DPI at their largest size. They're designed for large-format printing.

**Q: Can I use these commercially (staging, rentals)?**
A: This license is for personal use only. For commercial/staging use, message us for our commercial license.
