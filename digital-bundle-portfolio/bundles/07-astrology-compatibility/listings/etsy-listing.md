## FAQ Section

**Q: Which sign pairing do I choose?**
A: Select your Sun sign and your partner's Sun sign from the listing variations. If you're unsure of signs, we include a quick reference date chart. For the most comprehensive experience, consider the Universal Kit with all 12 sign profiles.

**Q: Is this personalized to MY specific birth chart?**
A: This guide is based on Sun sign pairings (the most significant compatibility factor for most people). For full natal chart personalization (Moon, Venus, Mars placements), message us about our Custom Report upgrade ($35).

**Q: I don't know much about astrology. Will I understand this?**
A: Absolutely. Every concept is explained in clear, accessible language. No jargon. No assumed knowledge. This is designed for astrology enthusiasts AND beginners.

**Q: Can same-sign couples use this?**
A: Yes! Same-sign pairings have their own unique dynamic — doubled strengths, amplified shadows. Our same-sign reports cover this in detail.

**Q: Is this inclusive of all relationship types?**
A: Yes. Language throughout uses "partner" and is designed to be inclusive of all couple configurations.

**Q: Do the dark pages use a lot of ink?**
A: Yes — the midnight blue pages look stunning but use significant ink. We include print-friendly (light background) alternative versions of all dark pages for ink-conscious printing.
