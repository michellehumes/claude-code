# Aries
*March 21 – April 19 · Fire · Cardinal · Ruled by Mars*

**Personality Essence**
Aries arrives like a first breath — bold, immediate, and impossible to ignore. They lead with courage, move with instinct, and love with a ferocity that can take your breath away. Where others hesitate, Aries has already begun.

**Strengths in Love**
- Passionately devoted when committed
- Will fight for the relationship without hesitation
- Brings excitement, energy, and spontaneity
- Fiercely protective of their partner's wellbeing

**Shadow Side in Relationships**
- Can be impatient with emotional processing
- May prioritize action over listening
- Tendency toward competitiveness, even with a partner

**How They Show Love**
Aries shows love through action. They'll champion your dreams before you've finished describing them. They plan, they initiate, they show up. Their love isn't whispered — it's demonstrated, daily, in ways big and small.

**What They Need From a Partner**
Aries needs a partner who can match their energy without trying to contain it. They need independence respected, honesty valued above comfort, and someone who isn't afraid to push back. A partner who admires their fire without trying to extinguish it.

**Communication Style**
Direct and unfiltered. Aries says what they mean and means what they say. They prefer short, honest conversations over long emotional processing. They resolve conflict by addressing it head-on, sometimes too quickly.

**Love Language Tendency**
Primary: Acts of Service
Secondary: Physical Touch
