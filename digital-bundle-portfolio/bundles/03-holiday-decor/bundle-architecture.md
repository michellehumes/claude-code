## Annual Reuse Positioning Strategy

**Key Message:** "Print once, display every year."

Marketing angles:
1. **Cost-per-year:** "$69 ÷ 10 years = $6.90/year for complete holiday decor"
2. **Sustainability:** "No plastic. No waste. Print what you need, store the files forever."
3. **Flexibility:** "Print different pieces each year for a fresh look from the same collection"
4. **Framing tip:** "Invest in neutral frames → swap art seasonally"

Include in listing: "This isn't a one-time purchase — it's your holiday decor library for years to come."

## Expandable SKU Logic

Same 72-piece structure → swap holiday/season:

| Variation | Season | Palette Shift |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Neutral Fall Harvest | September–November | Rust, amber, olive, cream |
| Valentine's Romantic Set | February | Dusty rose, burgundy, cream |
| Halloween Gothic Bundle | October | Black, deep purple, burnt orange |
| Spring/Easter Collection | March–April | Soft green, lavender, peach |
| Fourth of July | July | Navy, cream, muted red |

Each variation reuses 60% structure. Art subjects, copy, and palette change.
