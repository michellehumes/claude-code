━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q: Does this work with Google Sheets?
A: Yes! Upload the .xlsx file to Google Drive and open with Google Sheets. All formulas, dropdowns, and formatting work perfectly.

Q: Can I customize the habits?
A: Absolutely! The 15 pre-loaded habits are just suggestions. Rename any of them to match your personal goals, and use the 5 blank rows for additional habits.

Q: Is this a printable?
A: This is an interactive spreadsheet, not a printable PDF. The power is in the auto-calculating formulas and drop-down menus. However, you can print individual tabs if you prefer paper tracking.

Q: Can I reuse this every month?
A: Yes! Simply make a copy of the file for each new month. The structure stays the same — just clear the data and start fresh.

Q: I'm not good with spreadsheets. Can I still use this?
A: 100%. Everything is pre-built — formulas, dropdowns, formatting. The How to Use tab walks you through every single feature. Just fill in the cells and the spreadsheet does the rest.

A GENTLE REMINDER:
Progress, not perfection. A 60% consistency rate is still amazing. Missed a day? Just start again — no guilt needed. You're already doing great by investing in yourself.
