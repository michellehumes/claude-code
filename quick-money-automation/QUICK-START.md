## 🆘 IF YOU GET STUCK

**No jobs showing up?**
→ Try broader keywords: "design", "writing", "coding"
→ Remove budget filters
→ Look at "Jobs You May Like" section

**No client responses?**
→ Normal! Keep applying
→ Responses often come later
→ Your goal: 25+ applications, not instant replies

**Proposal rejected?**
→ Don't take it personally
→ It's a numbers game
→ Move on to next one immediately

**Not sure if you can do a job?**
→ If 70% sure, apply anyway
→ You can use AI tools to help
→ Say yes, figure out how later (within reason!)
