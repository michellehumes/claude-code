## Description

**Finally — ONE spreadsheet to manage your ENTIRE home.**

Stop juggling sticky notes, random apps, and scattered to-do lists. The **Home Organization & Cleaning Planner 2026** is a professional, all-in-one Excel spreadsheet with **8 powerful tabs** that cover everything from daily cleaning routines to home inventory, maintenance scheduling, budgeting, and meal planning.

---

### WHAT'S INSIDE (8 Tabs):

**Tab 1 — Weekly Cleaning Schedule**
Track daily cleaning tasks across 20 pre-loaded rooms and areas. Check off tasks for each day of the week, set priorities (High / Medium / Low), and add frequency notes. Never wonder "did I already clean that?" again.

**Tab 2 — Deep Cleaning Checklist**
60+ deep cleaning tasks organized by room — from descaling the coffee maker to steam-cleaning carpets. Enter the date you last completed a task and the spreadsheet **auto-calculates** when it's due next (weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually). Assign tasks to household members and track status at a glance.

**Tab 3 — Declutter Tracker**
Declutter room by room with columns for Keep, Donate, Trash, and Sell. Track the number of items sorted, mark completion dates, note whether you took before/after photos, and watch your progress grow.

**Tab 4 — Home Inventory**
100+ items pre-loaded across every room in your home. Track purchase date, purchase price, current estimated value, serial numbers, warranty expiration, insurance status, and photo references. **Essential for insurance claims, moving, and estate planning.**

**Tab 5 — Home Maintenance Schedule**
40+ home maintenance tasks with categories (HVAC, plumbing, exterior, yard, electrical, and more). Enter your last completion date and the spreadsheet **auto-calculates** the next due date. Track estimated costs, whether you need a professional, and save contractor contact info.

**Tab 6 — Household Budget**
20 budget categories pre-loaded (mortgage/rent, utilities, insurance, groceries, subscriptions, and more). Enter your monthly budget and actual spending — the spreadsheet **auto-calculates** the difference and percentage of budget used for each category.

**Tab 7 — Meal Planning & Groceries**
Plan breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for every day of the week. Includes a built-in grocery list section with quantity and estimated cost columns so you can plan meals AND budget at the same time.

**Tab 8 — How to Use Guide**
A complete, beginner-friendly walkthrough of every tab. Step-by-step instructions so you can start using the planner immediately — no spreadsheet experience needed.
