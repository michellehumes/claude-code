  "common_answers": {
    "tell_me_about_yourself": "I'm a strategic media leader with over 15 years of experience in pharmaceutical marketing. Currently at IPG Health, I lead the largest HCP account at the agency — a $22M+ integrated media strategy for Merck's oncology and U.S. Pharma portfolio, including Keytruda. I manage a team of 15 across digital, search, social, and point-of-care. What I'm most proud of is how I combine data-driven optimization with creative strategy — for example, I built an automated creative matrix system that reduced manual tracking by 50% while ensuring 100% compliance. I'm passionate about innovation, mentoring teams, and delivering measurable results.",
    "why_leaving": "I've had an incredible run at IPG Health and I'm proud of what I've built there — from managing the largest HCP account to developing my team. I'm now looking for my next challenge where I can bring my 15 years of pharmaceutical media expertise to a new environment and continue to grow as a leader. I'm particularly excited about opportunities where I can drive strategic innovation at a broader scale.",
    "greatest_strength": "My ability to translate complex data into clear, actionable media strategies. In pharma, we're dealing with multiple therapeutic areas, compliance requirements, and sophisticated audiences. I'm able to take all of that complexity and turn it into a clear strategic direction that my team can execute on and that clients trust. I also bring a strong combination of analytical rigor and relationship building — I've retained and expanded business by being a true strategic partner.",
    "greatest_weakness": "Earlier in my career, I tended to take on too much myself rather than delegating effectively. As I moved into leadership, I realized that developing my team means trusting them with meaningful work. I've become much more intentional about delegation — setting clear expectations, providing the right support, and then stepping back. It's made my team stronger and me a better leader.",
    "where_in_5_years": "I see myself in a senior leadership role where I'm shaping media strategy at an organizational level — whether that's as a VP or SVP leading a practice area or a portfolio of clients. I want to continue building high-performing teams and driving innovation in how we approach pharmaceutical media. I'm also passionate about mentoring the next generation of media leaders.",
    "salary_expectations": "I'm focused on finding the right opportunity and cultural fit. I'd love to learn more about the full compensation package. I'm confident we can find alignment based on my experience managing $22M+ budgets and leading large teams.",
    "why_this_company": "CUSTOMIZE: Research the specific company and add reasons here — their clients, culture, innovation, growth trajectory, etc.",
    "leadership_style": "I lead by empowering my team. I set a clear strategic vision and expectations, then give my team the autonomy to execute. I've built mentorship programs and streamlined workflows specifically so my 15 planners and specialists can do their best work. I believe in being accessible, giving direct feedback, and celebrating wins. My approach has led to strong retention and team members who've been promoted under my leadership.",
    "handling_conflict": "In pharma media, we deal with a lot of stakeholders — brand teams, legal, creative, vendors. When conflicts arise, I focus on understanding each perspective and finding the solution that serves the campaign goals. For example, when there's tension between creative ambition and compliance requirements, I bring both sides together early in the process so we can solve it collaboratively rather than reactively.",
    "biggest_accomplishment": "Leading the $22M+ Merck oncology media strategy as the largest HCP account at IPG Health. But what I'm most personally proud of is the automated creative matrix system I built. It was a real pain point — tracking label updates and asset expirations manually across dozens of brands. I partnered with our technology team to automate it, which cut manual tracking by 50% and got us to 100% compliance. It's a great example of how I think — find the bottleneck, innovate a solution, and deliver measurable impact."
