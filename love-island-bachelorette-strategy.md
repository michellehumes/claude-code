# Love Island Bachelorette Digital Downloads - Full Strategy

---

## 1. PRODUCT STRATEGY OVERVIEW

### The Concept
A **Love Island-themed Bachelorette Party Digital Download Pack** — a collection of printable games, signs, decor, and planning templates that lets a bride squad throw a full "villa weekend" bachelorette party. This sits alongside your existing Love Island water bottles as a natural upsell/cross-sell.

### Why This Works
- Love Island fans are passionate and want themed experiences, not generic bachelorette decor
- Digital downloads have zero inventory cost and infinite margin after creation
- The water bottle buyer is already a Love Island fan planning a party — the digital pack is the obvious next purchase
- Bachelorette party planners (bridesmaids) are actively searching for themed content and will buy bundles

### Product Tiers

| Tier | What's Included | Suggested Price |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Individual Items** | Single game or single sign sheet | $3.99 - $5.99 each |
| **Mini Pack** | 5-6 items (games + signs bundle) | $12.99 - $14.99 |
| **Ultimate Villa Pack** | Full 15-20 item bachelorette bundle | $24.99 - $29.99 |
| **Water Bottle + Digital Combo** | Listed as a separate listing pairing physical + digital | $34.99+ |

The **Ultimate Villa Pack** should be your hero listing — it gives the best perceived value and highest AOV.

## 4. VISUAL DESIGN DIRECTION

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Color palette:** Hot pink / fuchsia, coral, bright red, white, and touches of gold — mimicking the Love Island brand energy without directly copying their assets
- **Typography:** Mix of a bold/chunky display font (for headers like "WELCOME TO THE VILLA") with a clean sans-serif for body text and a playful script font for accents
- **Vibe:** Fun, bold, slightly cheeky — not minimalist, not overly cluttered. Think "Instagram-worthy party decor that photographs well"
- **Recurring motifs:** Hearts, palm trees, sunglasses, flamingos, lip prints, phone notification bubbles, tropical leaves

### Template Layout Notes

**Game Cards:**
- 5x7" card format, 2 per page for easy printing
- Bold header with game title
- Clean numbered or bulleted prompts/instructions
- Small decorative border (hearts, tropical elements)
- Each game has a consistent layout but unique accent color or icon

**Signs:**
- Large format: one sign per page (8.5x11" or scalable to poster size)
- Big bold text, centered
- Decorative frame or tropical background elements
- Customizable name/date fields clearly marked

**Planning Templates:**
- Clean and functional but on-brand
- Itinerary: left column for time, right for activity, styled like a TV schedule
- Invitation: phone screen mockup with text notification style

**Instagram Story Templates:**
- 1080x1920px
- Bold text overlays with transparent areas for photos
- On-brand colors and fonts matching the rest of the pack

## 5. CROSS-SELL STRATEGY WITH WATER BOTTLES

### Tactic 1: Bundle Listing
Create a separate Etsy listing that bundles the digital pack + water bottles.
- Title includes both "water bottle" and "digital downloads"
- Priced at a slight discount vs. buying separately (perceived value)
- Hero image shows both the physical bottles and mockups of the printables together

### Tactic 2: In-Listing Cross-Promotion
- Every water bottle listing description includes a line:
  "Planning a Love Island bachelorette? Grab our matching printable party pack — games, signs, and more! [Link in shop]"
- Every digital download listing includes:
  "Complete the villa experience with our Love Island water bottles! [Link in shop]"

### Tactic 3: Etsy Shop Sections
Organize your shop into clear sections:
- "Love Island Water Bottles"
- "Love Island Bachelorette Party Pack"
- "Love Island Bundles" (combo listings)

### Tactic 4: Listing Photos Cross-Sell
- Include one mockup image in the water bottle listing that shows the bottles alongside the printed games/signs (lifestyle shot)
- Include one mockup image in the digital listing that shows printed items alongside the water bottles

### Tactic 5: Post-Purchase Follow-Up
- Include a "Thank You" card PDF in the water bottle shipment with a QR code or short link to the digital download listing
- Include a note in the digital download files: "Love these? Check out our matching Love Island Water Bottles — perfect for your villa weekend!"

### Tactic 6: Sticker Add-On
- Create a small Love Island sticker sheet listing (digital or physical)
- Position it as a low-cost add-on ($2.99-$3.99)
- Include sticker designs: "Coupled Up," "It Is What It Is," "I Got a Text," "Villa Vibes," the bride's name
- If physical stickers: bundle option with water bottles
- If digital stickers: include in the Ultimate Villa Pack as a bonus or sell separately

## 6. LAUNCH SEQUENCE

### Phase 1 — Build
- Design and finalize all templates (Canva or Adobe Illustrator)
- Create listing mockup images (use smartmockups.com or Canva mockup frames)
- Photograph water bottles alongside printed samples for lifestyle images

### Phase 2 — List
- Publish the Ultimate Villa Pack listing first (hero product)
- Publish 2-3 individual game listings (to capture long-tail search traffic)
- Publish the combo/bundle listing with water bottles
- Update existing water bottle listings with cross-sell language

### Phase 3 — Promote
- Pin the Ultimate Villa Pack to the top of your Etsy shop
- Create a short TikTok/Reel showing the "unboxing" of the printed pack set up at a party
- Use Pinterest pins for each sign and game (Pinterest drives heavy Etsy traffic for printables)
- Post in wedding planning Facebook groups and subreddits (where allowed)

### Phase 4 — Iterate
- Monitor which individual games sell best — consider making those into standalone premium listings
- Add seasonal variations (summer villa pack, winter lodge version)
- Collect reviews and update listing photos with customer setup photos
