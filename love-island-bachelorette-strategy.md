# Villa Vibes Bachelorette Digital Downloads - Full Strategy

## TRADEMARK-SAFE REBRANDING NOTE

This strategy has been fully rebranded to avoid infringing on ITV Studios'
"Love Island" trademarks. All product names, game titles, sign copy, and
listing language use original terminology that captures the same villa/dating
show aesthetic without using any protected names or catchphrases.

**Key branding substitutions applied throughout:**

| Protected Term (DO NOT USE)  | Safe Alternative (USED HERE)              |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Love Island                  | Villa Vibes / Villa Party / Villa Weekend  |
| I Got a Text!                | New Message! / You've Got a Message        |
| Recoupling / Recouple        | The Switch-Up / Partner Pick               |
| Casa Amor                    | The Secret Villa / The Other Villa          |
| The Firepit                  | The Hot Seat / Gossip Corner               |
| Grafting                     | Shooting Your Shot / Flirting Game         |
| Coupled Up                   | Matched Up / Taken                         |
| Islander                     | Villa Guest / Villa Babe                   |
| Stick or Twist               | Stay or Switch                             |
| Do Bits Society              | (avoid entirely)                           |

## 1. PRODUCT STRATEGY OVERVIEW

### The Concept
A **Villa-themed Bachelorette Party Digital Download Pack** — a collection of
printable games, signs, decor, and planning templates that lets a bride squad
throw a full "villa weekend" bachelorette party. The dating-show villa
aesthetic is wildly popular, and this pack captures that energy with original
branding. It sits alongside your water bottles as a natural upsell/cross-sell.

### Why This Works
- Dating-show and villa-themed parties are a massive trend — fans want themed
  experiences, not generic bachelorette decor
- Digital downloads have zero inventory cost and infinite margin after creation
- The water bottle buyer is already a villa-aesthetic fan planning a party —
  the digital pack is the obvious next purchase
- Bachelorette party planners (bridesmaids) are actively searching for themed
  content and will buy bundles
- Original branding means no risk of trademark takedowns or shop closure

### Product Tiers

| Tier | What's Included | Suggested Price |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Individual Items** | Single game or single sign sheet | $3.99 - $5.99 each |
| **Mini Pack** | 5-6 items (games + signs bundle) | $12.99 - $14.99 |
| **Ultimate Villa Pack** | Full 15-20 item bachelorette bundle | $24.99 - $29.99 |
| **Water Bottle + Digital Combo** | Listed as a separate listing pairing physical + digital | $34.99+ |

The **Ultimate Villa Pack** should be your hero listing — it gives the best
perceived value and highest AOV (average order value).

## 2. WHAT'S IN THE PACK — FULL PRODUCT LIST

### Category A: Party Games (8 printable game sets)

1. **"Drink If..." Villa Edition**
   - A card with 20-25 prompts like: "Drink if you've ever slid into
     someone's DMs," "Drink if you'd switch partners on Day 1," "Drink if
     you've said 'it is what it is' unironically," "Drink if you've stalked
     an ex's new partner online"

2. **"The Switch-Up" — Partner Pick Game**
   - Each guest writes down which two friends at the party they'd "match up"
     and why. The bride reads them out loud and the group votes on the best
     pairings. Includes printable matching cards.

3. **"New Message!" — Bride Trivia Game**
   - Trivia cards about the bride (her love story, her preferences,
     embarrassing moments). The host reads each question like a dramatic
     phone notification announcement. Includes a phone-shaped card template
     with a message bubble design.

4. **"The Secret Villa" — Two Truths and a Lie**
   - Each guest shares two truths and one lie about their love life. The
     group votes on who's lying — whoever fools the most people wins.
     Themed scorecards included.

5. **"The Compatibility Quiz"**
   - A quiz the groom fills out ahead of time (favorite date, most annoying
     habit, first impression of the bride, etc.). At the party, the bride
     answers the same questions. Group scores how well they match.
     Printable quiz sheet + answer key.

6. **"Rate the Date" Card Game**
   - Each guest anonymously writes their worst or funniest date story on
     a card. The group reads them aloud and rates them 1-10 with the
     included rating paddles. Best (worst?) story wins.

7. **"Villa Dare Cards" — Challenge Edition**
   - A stack of dare/challenge cards at three spice levels (Mild, Medium,
     Spicy). Examples: "Do your best slow-mo entrance walk across the room,"
     "Give a 30-second speech about why you deserve a rose," "Text your most
     recent ex something nice and screenshot it." Group picks the level
     before each draw.

8. **"Shoot Your Shot" — Pickup Line Battle**
   - Two guests face off reading the worst/best/cheesiest pickup lines.
     The group votes on who delivered it better. Loser drinks. Printable
     line cards included (30+ lines).

### Category B: Signs & Decor (7 printable signs)

1. **"Welcome to the Villa" Entry Sign**
   - Large format (A3/poster size). Customizable with the bride's name

   - Styled sign for the drink table / bar cart area

3. **"New Message!" Phone Photo Prop**

     happen

7. **"Main Villa / Secret Villa" Directional Arrow Signs**

     vs. living room, pool vs. inside, etc.)

### Category C: Planning & Organization Templates (4 templates)

1. **Bachelorette Weekend Itinerary Template**
   - Editable/fillable itinerary styled like a reality TV episode schedule:
     "Episode 1: Arrival at the Villa | Episode 2: Pool Party & Challenges |
     Episode 3: The Final Switch-Up & Night Out"

2. **Digital Invitation Template — "You've Been Selected for the Villa"**
   - Phone notification-styled invite. The design looks like a message
     popping up on screen: "BREAKING: You've been selected to enter the
     Villa. [Name]'s Bachelorette Weekend. [Date]. [Location]. Do you
     accept?" Customizable fields for name, date, location, dress code.

3. **"Villa Rules" House Rules Poster**
   - Funny + practical house rules for the weekend:
     "1. The bride is always right. 2. No phones in the hot tub.
     3. What happens at the villa stays at the villa. 4. If you're not
     having fun, fake it til you make it. 5. Drama is encouraged.
     6. Last one up makes the coffee. 7. No outside couples drama
     allowed. 8. Matching outfits = bonus points."

4. **"What to Pack for the Villa" Checklist**
   - Themed packing list: bikinis/swimwear, your going-out outfit,
     sunscreen, sunglasses, a good attitude, "your best flirting game,"
     a funny story for game night, comfortable shoes for dancing, etc.

### Category D: Extras & Bonus Items (4 items)

## 4. VISUAL DESIGN DIRECTION

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Color palette:** Hot pink / fuchsia, coral, warm peach, white, and
  touches of gold. This reads as "villa summer party" without copying any
  specific show's brand kit. Avoid the exact neon pink + turquoise combo
  that is closely associated with the TV show's branding.
- **Typography:** Mix of a bold/chunky display font (for headers like
  "WELCOME TO THE VILLA") with a clean sans-serif for body text and a
  playful script font for accents (names, "Villa Vibes," etc.)
- **Vibe:** Fun, bold, slightly cheeky — not minimalist, not overly
  cluttered. Think "Instagram-worthy party decor that photographs well"
- **Recurring motifs:** Hearts, palm trees, sunglasses, flamingos, lip
  prints, phone notification bubbles, tropical leaves, cocktail glasses,
  stars. These are all generic tropical/party motifs not owned by anyone.
- **What to AVOID visually:** Do not replicate the specific Love Island
  logo font, the show's exact color scheme, the show's heart logo, or
  any screenshots/imagery from the show itself.

### Template Layout Notes

**Game Cards:**
- 5x7" card format, 2 per page for easy printing
- Bold header with game title
- Clean numbered or bulleted prompts/instructions
- Small decorative border (hearts, tropical elements)
- Each game has a consistent layout but a unique accent color or icon
  so the pack feels cohesive but not repetitive

**Signs:**
- Large format: one sign per page (8.5x11" or scalable to poster size)
- Big bold text, centered
- Decorative frame or tropical background elements
- Customizable name/date fields clearly marked with "[Your Name Here]"
  placeholder text

**Planning Templates:**
- Clean and functional but on-brand
- Itinerary: left column for time, right for activity, styled like a
  reality TV episode schedule
- Invitation: phone screen mockup with notification/message bubble style

**Instagram Story Templates:**
- 1080x1920px
- Bold text overlays with transparent areas for photos
- On-brand colors and fonts matching the rest of the pack
- Include editable text fields for hashtag and handle

**Cocktail Tent Cards:**
- Folded tent card format (prints on half a letter page)
- Drink name in bold, suggested recipe in smaller text below
- Same decorative elements as the rest of the pack

## 5. CROSS-SELL STRATEGY WITH WATER BOTTLES

### Important: Audit Your Existing Water Bottle Listings First
Before launching the digital pack, review your current water bottle listings:
- Remove any use of "Love Island" from titles, tags, and descriptions
- Rebrand to "Villa Vibes" / "Villa Party" language to match the new pack
- This protects your entire shop from takedown risk and creates a cohesive
  brand across all your products

### Tactic 1: Bundle Listing
Create a separate Etsy listing that bundles the digital pack + water bottles.
- Title includes both "water bottle" and "digital downloads"
- Priced at a slight discount vs. buying separately (perceived value)
- Hero image shows both the physical bottles and mockups of the printables
  together — this lifestyle shot is key for conversion

### Tactic 2: In-Listing Cross-Promotion
- Every water bottle listing description includes:
  "Planning a villa bachelorette weekend? Grab our matching printable party
  pack — games, signs, and more! Check our shop for the full Villa Vibes
  collection."
- Every digital download listing includes:
  "Complete the villa look with our matching Villa Water Bottles — the
  perfect pair for your bachelorette weekend!"

### Tactic 3: Etsy Shop Sections
Organize your shop into clear sections:
- "Villa Vibes Water Bottles"
- "Villa Vibes Bachelorette Party Pack"
- "Villa Vibes Bundles" (combo listings)
- "Villa Vibes Stickers" (if you add this line)

This creates a branded "Villa Vibes" collection feel across your shop.

### Tactic 4: Listing Photos Cross-Sell
- Include one mockup image in the water bottle listing that shows the
  bottles alongside the printed games/signs (lifestyle shot)
- Include one mockup image in the digital listing that shows printed
  items alongside the water bottles
- This visually plants the seed: "I need both of these"

### Tactic 5: Post-Purchase Follow-Up
- Include a "Thank You" card PDF in the water bottle shipment with a QR
  code or short link to the digital download listing
- Include a note in the digital download files: "Love the villa vibes?
  Check out our matching Villa Water Bottles — perfect for your weekend!"

### Tactic 6: Sticker Add-On
- Create a small sticker sheet listing (digital printable stickers or
  physical stickers, or both)
- Position it as a low-cost add-on ($2.99-$3.99)
- Include sticker designs with safe phrases:
  - "Matched Up"
  - "Villa Vibes"
  - "Main Character Energy"
  - "Currently Taken"
  - "It Is What It Is" (this phrase is common slang, NOT trademarked)
  - The bride's name (customizable)
  - "Stay or Switch?"
  - "She Said Yes"
- If physical stickers: bundle option with water bottles
- If digital stickers: include in the Ultimate Villa Pack as a bonus
  or sell separately

---

## 6. LAUNCH SEQUENCE

### Phase 1 — Build
- Design and finalize all templates in Canva (recommended for editable
  customer templates) or Adobe Illustrator (for fixed PDF designs)
- Create listing mockup images using smartmockups.com or Canva mockup
  frames — show the printables in real-life party settings
- Photograph water bottles alongside printed samples for lifestyle images
- Have 1-2 friends print a test copy to check colors, sizing, and
  readability before listing

### Phase 2 — List
- Publish the **Ultimate Villa Pack** listing first (hero product)
- Publish 2-3 **individual game listings** (to capture long-tail search)
- Publish the **Games-Only Mini Pack** and **Signs-Only Mini Pack**
- Publish the **combo/bundle listing** with water bottles
- **Update existing water bottle listings** with rebranded language and
  cross-sell copy

### Phase 3 — Promote
- Pin the Ultimate Villa Pack to the top of your Etsy shop
- Create a short TikTok/Reel showing the pack "unboxed" — print
  everything out, set it up at a real or staged party, film the
  transformation
- Use Pinterest pins for each individual sign and game — Pinterest
  drives heavy Etsy traffic for printables (create one pin per item,
  each linking back to the relevant listing)
- Post in wedding planning Facebook groups and subreddits (where
  self-promotion is allowed)
- Reach out to bachelorette party planning accounts on Instagram for
  potential features or collaborations

### Phase 4 — Iterate
- Monitor which individual games sell best — consider making top sellers
  into expanded standalone listings (e.g., "Drink If" with 50 prompts
  instead of 25)
- Add seasonal variations (summer pool villa pack, winter cozy lodge
  version, tropical destination version)
- Collect reviews and ask happy buyers if you can reshare their setup
  photos — user-generated content is gold for Etsy conversions
- Consider expanding the "Villa Vibes" brand into other bachelorette
  items: matching tees design (print-on-demand), tote bags, koozies

## 7. REVENUE PROJECTIONS & PRICING MATH

### Per-Sale Revenue (digital only — no COGS)
| Product | Price | Etsy Fees (~13%) | Net Per Sale |
|---------|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Individual Game | $4.99 | $0.65 | ~$4.34 |
| Mini Pack | $13.99 | $1.82 | ~$12.17 |
| Ultimate Villa Pack | $27.99 | $3.64 | ~$24.35 |
| Bundle (digital + bottle) | $39.99 | $5.20 | ~$34.79 (minus bottle COGS) |

### Cross-Sell Impact
If even 20% of your water bottle buyers also purchase the digital pack,
that's a significant bump in average order value with zero additional
shipping or production cost.

## 8. NEXT STEPS — READY FOR YOUR APPROVAL

Once you review and approve this rebranded strategy, here's the build order:

- [ ] Finalize which items make the cut for the pack
- [ ] Set up Canva brand kit (colors, fonts, motifs) for consistency
- [ ] Design each template (game cards, signs, planning templates, extras)
- [ ] Create Etsy listing mockup images
- [ ] Finalize all listing copy and tags
- [ ] Audit and update existing water bottle listings with safe language
- [ ] Set up cross-sell copy across all listings
- [ ] Publish and promote

**Review questions:**
1. Does the rebranded "Villa Vibes" naming feel right for your shop?
2. Does the full product list (23 items) feel like the right scope, or do
   you want to start smaller?
3. Any color palette or design preferences beyond what's described?
4. Do you want physical stickers, digital printable sticker sheets, or both?
5. Anything else you'd want a bridesmaid to have when planning this weekend?
